# Curriculum Build Setup Guide

Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.

1. **Create Virtual Environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv curriculum_env
```

2. **Activate Virtual Environment**

```bash
source curriculum_env/bin/activate
```

If successful, your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with `(curriculum_env)`.

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You're now ready to run the curriculum build script.

Remember to keep your virtual environment activated while developing and running your project. If you wish to deactivate the virtual environment, simply run the `deactivate` command in your terminal.
