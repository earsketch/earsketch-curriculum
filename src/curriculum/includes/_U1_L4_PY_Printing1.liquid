#Setup
from earsketch import *
init()
        # (We don't need setTempo here, since there's no music)

#Printing
print 3 * 4           # Prints the result of 3*4: 12
                      # Notice that print does not have parentheses! This is just a quirk in Python.

x = 3 * 4
print x               # Prints the value of x, which is also 3*4, on the next line in the console

y = 2
print x / y           #Evaluates x/y, then prints it on the next line

#Finish
finish()
