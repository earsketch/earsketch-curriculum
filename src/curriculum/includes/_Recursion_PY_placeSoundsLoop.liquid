# an alternate version of placeSoundsOnTrack() that uses iteration instead of recursion
def placeSoundsOnTrack_iter(soundlist, tracknum, start, cliplength):
	for i in range(len(soundlist)):
		fitMedia(soundlist[i], tracknum, start+(cliplength*i), start+(cliplength*(i+1)))
# notice that the above code is not nearly as elegant as the recursive version shown earlier.
