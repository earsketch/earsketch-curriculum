00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.337 align:middle line:10% position:19% size:31%
Now we're going
to use Boolean expressions

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:08.242 align:middle line:10% position:16% size:37%
inside of an if-else statement,
and also use console input

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:10.644 align:middle line:10% position:16% size:38%
to ask a user what kind of music
they want to hear,

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:14.281 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:33%
and use fitMedia() to create
different sounds in our DAW

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.617 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:36%
depending on what they answer.

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:19.152 align:middle line:10% position:16% size:37%
So the first thing I need to do
is to ask the user

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:35%
what kind of music they want.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.689 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:36%
So I'll define a variable here
called a,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.627 align:middle line:10% position:21% size:25%
and I'll assign it
the result of calling

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:27.761 align:middle line:10% position:19% size:30%
the readInput() function.

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:10% position:21% size:26%
And I'll ask the user:

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.436 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:32%
"Do you like hip-hop music?
Type yes or no."

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:43.143 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:35%
So now a is going to be set
to whatever the user types in

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:46.013 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:36%
when the dialogue box pops up.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:49.316 align:middle line:10% position:16% size:38%
And so I can use an if statement
to see what they typed in.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:53.921 align:middle line:10% position:21% size:25%
So I can check to see
if (a == "yes"),

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.323 align:middle line:10% position:21% size:25%
well that means
they do like hip-hip,

00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:00.861 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:36%
so I'll play hip hop for them.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.163 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:32%
If they didn't type in yes,
then I'm going to use

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.766 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:35%
an else statement
to catch the other condition.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.135 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:33%
They did not type in yes,
so they probably typed in no

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:12.472 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:33%
or something else like that,
and there I could play

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.141 align:middle line:10% position:24% size:18%
something else.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:19.212 align:middle line:10% position:16% size:37%
So within each of these blocks,
I'm going to put in

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:22.115 align:middle line:10% position:19% size:30%
the fitMedia() statements
that create

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.083 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:29%
the right kind of music.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:35%
So, in this if block,
I'm going to first just print

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.188 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:32%
to the console
so they know what happened,

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.323 align:middle line:10% position:22% size:24%
say "Hip-hop it is!"

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:31.925 align:middle line:10% position:19% size:30%
And then put in
two fitMedia() statements

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:10% position:23% size:22%
with two different
hip-hop sounds

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.529 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:32%
in track one and track two.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.864 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:33%
And if they didn't say that,
I'm going to play them

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.399 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:29%
some funk music instead.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.503 align:middle line:10% position:19% size:30%
So in my else block,
I'm going to put in again

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.272 align:middle line:10% position:21% size:25%
a print statement
to put on the console

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.606 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:29%
"Ok, here is some funk."

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:28%
And then two fitMedia()
function calls putting

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.212 align:middle line:10% position:21% size:25%
two different sounds
on tracks one and two

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.547 align:middle line:10% position:25% size:17%
that are funk.

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:57.985 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:33%
So now, if I press run here,
the dialogue box comes up,

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:35%
asks if I like hip-hop music.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
I'll type in "yes."
And I get hip-hop music.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:19.473 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:31%
[electronic hip-hop music]

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.709 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
If I press run again,
and instead I type in

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.211 align:middle line:79% position:23% size:21%
"No, I don't like
hip-hop music,"

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.013 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:28%
well then it says
"Ok, here's some funk,"

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:28.348 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:24%
in the console,
and I get two tracks

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.316 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:28%
of funk sounds up here.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:45.732 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:28%
[electronic funk music]

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.535 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
Now there is one problem
that we need to deal with.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:52.172 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:33%
I press run, and I type in
"Yes, I like hip-hop music,"

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.709 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
but I use a capital Y
at the beginning,

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:79% position:23% size:22%
it's still going
to play some funk.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.446 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:28%
And the reason for that
is that I'm checking

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:00.047 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:19%
what I typed in.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:03.417 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:35%
I'm checking to see
if it's y-e-s all lower case.

00:03:03.417 --> 00:03:07.387 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:36%
So if I type in anything else,
like y-e-s with a capital Y

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:11.425 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:30%
or Y-E-S all capitals,
this is going to evaluate

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:14.594 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:26%
to be false
and therefore is going

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.196 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
to jump down
to the else statement

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.366 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:36%
and execute this block of code
instead of executing

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.268 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:31%
this hip-hop code up here.

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:22.669 align:middle line:79% position:24% size:19%
So to fix that,
I need to put in

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.304 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:30%
some other conditions
that I want to check for.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:27.474 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:24%
So I don't just want
to see if a == "yes"

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:28.809 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:26%
all lower case,
but I also want to see

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:35.182 align:middle line:79% position:16% size:38%
does a == "Yes" with a capital Y
at the beginning,

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:39.086 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:35%
or for that matter,
does a = "YES," all capitals?

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:41.388 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:30%
And since I have "or"
in between each of these,

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.958 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:33%
this means that any of these
three comparisons is true,

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.893 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
then the whole thing
will evaluate to true

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.464 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
and so therefore
will play hip-hop music.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:54.601 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
So now, if I run this
and I type in Y-E-S,

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:58.138 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
all capitals,
it says "Hip-hop it is,"

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:00.507 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:30%
and it plays
the hip-hop music for me.
