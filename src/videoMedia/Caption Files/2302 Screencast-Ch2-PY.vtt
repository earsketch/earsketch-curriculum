Narrator: Let's go ahead
and write some music

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:07.608 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:35%
using variables in EarSketch.

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.476 align:middle line:79% position:23% size:22%
I have the start
of my script here,

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:13.313 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
"from earsketch import *,"
the init() function,

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.983 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:32%
which starts the new
music project in EarSketch,

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:17.751 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:29%
the setTempo() function.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.786 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
And I'm going to slow down
that tempo,

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:22.022 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:26%
so instead of it being
120 beats per minute,

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.691 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
I'm going to make it
100 beats per minute.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.593 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:26%
And then I have
the finish() function,

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.562 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
which gets all the music
ready to play

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:24%
inside of EarSketch.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.198 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
And it's always at the end
of our script.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.301 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
So now I'm going
to define a variable.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:35.903 align:middle line:85% position:21% size:26%
I'll call it "synth1."

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:38.305 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
I'll use the equals sign
to assign that variable,

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.539 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:19%
synth1, a value.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.809 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:35%
The value here is going to be
a constant

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.445 align:middle line:79% position:23% size:22%
from the EarSketch
sound browser.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:51.184 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:33%
So I'll pick this
"HIPHOP_SYNTHPLUCKLEAD_005."

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:55.555 align:middle line:79% position:16% size:37%
And so now I have synth1,
the variable, equals the value,

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.025 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:31%
HIPHOP_SYNTHPLUCKLEAD_005.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.061 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:24%
So now I want to use
that variable synth1

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.062 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:15%
in my music.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.431 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:32%
So I'll put in
a fitMedia() function call.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.934 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:28%
And the sound I'm going
to put in will be

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.937 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:32%
that variable name, synth1,
since that represents

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.405 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:29%
the sound I want to use.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.207 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:28%
I'll put it on track 1,
starting at measure 1

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.944 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:29%
and ending in measure 2.

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:20.547 align:middle line:10% position:22% size:23%
Now I can press run

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.516 align:middle line:10% position:23% size:22%
and I can play it.

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:85% position:25% size:17%
[synth melody]

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.556 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:35%
So now that I've successfully
used one variable

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.924 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:28%
in my EarSketch script,
I can go ahead

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.327 align:middle line:79% position:23% size:21%
and I can define
a couple of more.

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.828 align:middle line:10% position:22% size:23%
So I can make
one called "synth2"

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.564 align:middle line:10% position:22% size:24%
and assign that
to a different sound

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:40.067 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:28%
from the sound browser.

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:10% position:19% size:31%
I'll use
"HIPHOP_SOLOMOOGLEAD_001."

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.907 align:middle line:10% position:16% size:38%
And I can define
a third variable called "drums."

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:51.445 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:36%
I'll use the equals sign
to assign that to a drum beat.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.822 align:middle line:10% position:18% size:33%
Now that I have all of that,
I can put in a bunch

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.156 align:middle line:10% position:22% size:24%
of fitMedia() calls.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:29%
And each fitMedia() call
can use one

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:09.763 align:middle line:10% position:16% size:38%
of those three variables,
either synth1, synth2, or drums.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:11.698 align:middle line:10% position:21% size:25%
So you can see
all of my calls here.

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.935 align:middle line:10% position:20% size:28%
I have synth1, synth2,
synth2, synth1, synth2,

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:18.839 align:middle line:10% position:17% size:35%
synth1, synth2, and drums.
Most of these are on track 1.

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.741 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:26%
They're kind of going
one measure at a time,

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:22.242 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:28%
so the first one
is from measure 1 to 2,

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.944 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:24%
the next one
from measure 2 to 3,

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:24.978 align:middle line:85% position:26% size:12%
and so on.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.347 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
I have a break here
between measure 4 and 5,

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:28.915 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:23%
but everything else
is filled in.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:32.119 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
But then I want my drums
to be on track 2,

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:36.223 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:32%
so that I hear the drums
throughout the entire song.

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.059 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:30%
So I have fitMedia(drums)
on track 2

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.928 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:24%
going from measure 1
to measure 9.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:44.998 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
So I can hit run and hear
what that sounds like now.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:03:06.787 align:middle line:85% position:16% size:37%
[synth hip-hop beat with drums]

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:33%
So now what if I wanted
to change one of the sounds?

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.962 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
Let's say I wanted
to change my synth1 sound,

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.697 align:middle line:85% position:17% size:35%
my HIPHOP_SYNTHPLUCKLEAD_005,

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.267 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:35%
to change it
to HIPHOP_SYNTHPLUCKLEAD_006.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:21.935 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
Maybe that would
sound better in the piece?

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.837 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:35%
Well,
if I weren't using variables,

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:26.239 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:33%
I'd have to go through
every single fitMedia() call

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.342 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
where I was using synth1
and manually put in

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:85% position:18% size:33%
the new sound that I wanted.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.846 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
But here I can just change
the assignment statement

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:36.149 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
at the top here,
and then everything below,

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.485 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
every time I use synth1,
it's going to use

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.654 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:31%
the updated sound instead.

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:42.022 align:middle line:79% position:23% size:21%
So I just changed
that one thing,

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:45.959 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:33%
and it kind of propagates
through the rest of my code.

00:03:47.461 --> 00:04:07.247 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:35%
[different synth hip-hop beat
with drums]

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:10.484 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
Now this is important
because it ties

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:13.086 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:30%
into a very important way
of composing music

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.122 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:31%
called "iterative design."

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:28%
And when we make music
using iterative design,

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:33%
we start off with something
that we think might be okay.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.063 align:middle line:79% position:16% size:37%
We kind of put some ideas down,
make some music.

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.631 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:30%
And then we listen to it,
and we think about

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:85% position:19% size:31%
how we can make it better.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.201 align:middle line:79% position:22% size:23%
And we make changes
to that music.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
And then we play it again,
and we listen to it again.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.705 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:30%
We think about how we can
make it better,

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:32.839 align:middle line:85% position:22% size:23%
what we can change.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:34.174 align:middle line:79% position:23% size:22%
Sometimes we might
make it worse,

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:36.843 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:32%
so we might want to go back
and kind of undo a change

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:37.878 align:middle line:85% position:23% size:21%
that we just did.

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.547 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
But the point is
that we rapidly go through

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:44.251 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
this process
of editing the music,

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:46.786 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
listening to it,
and making more changes,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.455 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:32%
until we end with something
that's really awesome

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.157 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:29%
and that we're proud of.

00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:53.793 align:middle line:79% position:16% size:37%
And this notion of variables,
using variables in our scripts,

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:79% position:19% size:31%
makes it much easier
to experiment in this way.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.567 align:middle line:79% position:18% size:32%
Because if you have
a long song that has dozens

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:04.571 align:middle line:79% position:16% size:37%
of different sounds in it
that are used hundreds of times

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.673 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:26%
through function calls
like fitMedia(),

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.242 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:26%
and you want to change
one of those sounds,

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:12.245 align:middle line:79% position:16% size:38%
it would take a really long time
to go through all your code,

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.981 align:middle line:79% position:16% size:37%
find every time you're using it
and change it.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.584 align:middle line:79% position:17% size:36%
But if you can use a variable
so that you can just change it

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.953 align:middle line:79% position:16% size:38%
once in an assignment statement,
then you just have to make

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.922 align:middle line:79% position:21% size:25%
that one tiny change,
run your code again,

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:24.691 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
and you can very quickly
hear the difference

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:29%
and decide whether it
makes it better or worse

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.595 align:middle line:79% position:20% size:28%
and what you might want
to do next.
