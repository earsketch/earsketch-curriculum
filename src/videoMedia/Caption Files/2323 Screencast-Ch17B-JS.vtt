Narrator: We're going to use
Boolean expressions

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.706 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
and "if/else" statements
and console input

00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:08.208 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
to ask the user what kind
of music they want to hear.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.510 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
And then use
fitMedia() function calls

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.815 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
to place the corresponding
kind of music into the DAW.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.384 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
We'll start by asking
the user what they want to hear.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.353 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
So I'm going to define
a variable.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.022 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
I'll just call it "a"
and assign to it

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.924 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
the result of calling
a readInput() function.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.792 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
And I'll ask the user,

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:36.136 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
"Do you like hip-hop music?
Type yes or no."

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
Now, I need to use
an "if" statement

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.975 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
with a Boolean expression
to figure out

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.044 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
what they actually typed in.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:53.253 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
So, if a == "yes"
I want to play some hip-hop.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:57.591 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
Else, if "a" did not equal
"yes," if it equaled "no"

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.894 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
or something else like that,
then I want to play

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.496 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
some other kind of music.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:05.866 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
And so, in each of these blocks,
I need to put some fitMedia()

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.235 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
function calls,
so it'll place the appropriate

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.137 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
music into the DAW.

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:13.774 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
So, for the hip-hop case,
that's my "if" block.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:18.378 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
First, I'll use println()
to say on the console

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:21.114 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
so they know what's going on,
"Hip-hop it is."

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.016 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
And then I've got two fitMedia()
function calls here plays

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.553 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
two different hip-hop sounds
on tracks 1 and 2 of the DAW.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.789 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
And then I'll do something
similar on the "else" block,

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.324 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
but instead
of putting in hip-hop,

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:33.493 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
I'll put in some funk sounds.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.729 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
So again I have
a println() function saying,

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.264 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
"Okay, here is some funk,"
and then two

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.466 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
fitMedia() function calls
placing two different

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:43.337 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
funk sounds
on tracks 1 and 2 of the DAW.

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:44.838 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
So now I can press run.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.174 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Asks me "do I like
hip-hop music, type yes or no."

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:50.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
I type in "yes"
and I get hip-hop.

00:01:50.477 --> 00:02:06.827 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[hip-hop music]

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:10.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
If I run the same script
but I type in "no,"

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
then I get the funk.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:29.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
[funk music]

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:32.686 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And there's one problem here:
Press run and I type in

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:36.123 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
"yes I like hip-hop music,"
but I use a capital "Y."

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:38.258 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It says,
"Okay, here is some funk,"

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and it gives me funk sounds.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The reason for that
is if my Boolean expression here

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.266 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is checking if a equals "yes"
all lower-case.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.702 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And so it doesn't account
for different ways

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:51.638 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I might type in the word "yes"
with different capitalizations.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So to catch all those cases,
I need to add more

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:56.676 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to my Boolean expression.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.746 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So I need to see
if "a" equals "yes"

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:04.684 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
or "a" equals "Yes"
with a capital "Y"

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:08.121 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
or if "a" equals "Y-E-S,"
all capital.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.024 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So if any of those
three things are true,

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:15.429 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
this will now be true
and will execute the "if" block

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.632 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and will put
the hip-hop music in.

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:24.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So now, if I press run,
I can type in "YES" all capital,

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.807 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and I'll get hip-hop
like I expected.
