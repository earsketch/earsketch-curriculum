Instructor: Let's look
at some Boolean expressions

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.504 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
in EarSketch now.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.406 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
I've defined a few variables
in my script

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.108 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
for some common things
we might use

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.344 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
in an EarSketch script,
like a starting measure.

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:11.712 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
I assigned 1 to startMeasure.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.481 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
I assigned measure 9
to endMeasure.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.717 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
I assigned a sound
to a sound variable

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
and I assigned a track
to the track variable.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.089 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
So let's define
a Boolean variable now

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.992 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
and assign it
Boolean expression

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.594 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
"endMeasure &gt; 10."

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:31.131 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Then let me print out
the value of "a" to my console

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:34.434 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
so that I can see
whether it's true or false.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.004 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:41%
So in evaluating
endMeasure &gt; 10,

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.606 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
we look at what the value
of endMeasure is.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.075 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
And up here we assigned
endMeasure to be 9.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:46.013 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
So here all I'm checking
is 9 &gt; 10.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.815 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
So is 9 &gt; 10? No.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.252 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
Therefore, this expression, "a,"
is assigned "false."

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.455 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
And you can see when I run this
it prints "false"

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.258 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
to the EarSketch console.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:03.463 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
I can check instead,
endMeasure equal to 9.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:07.367 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
So this is saying,
"Does 9 equal 9?"

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.536 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
And of course, 9 does equal 9.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.005 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
So now when I run it,
I'll get a value

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.975 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
of "true" for "a."

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:16.543 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
We can check
all different kinds of things

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:17.911 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
with Boolean expressions.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.646 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
I can check the value
of my sound—

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:28.188 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
I can say, "Is 'sound' not equal
to YO3_DRUMS_SAMPLE_1?"

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
And here that's basically saying

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.196 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
"Does YO3_DRUMS_SAMPLE_1
not equal YO3_DRUMS_SAMPLE_1?"

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.298 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
But is something not equal
itself?

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.434 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
Well that's going to be false
because of course something

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:42.936 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
does equal itself,
but I'm checking for not equal.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
So when I run this
I get the value of "false."

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.843 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
I can also check things
with the track variable.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.745 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:33%
Is track &gt; 1?

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:53.747 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
Well again the value
of track here is 7.

00:01:53.747 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
So is 7 &gt; 1?
True, because 7 is &gt; 1.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.322 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
I can also build up
compound expressions here

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
using "and" and "or."

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.463 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
So is track &gt; 1
and track &lt; 5?

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:15.936 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
Well is 7 &gt; 1 and 7 &lt; 5?

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:19.239 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
We know 7 is &gt; 1,
so that part is true,

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.109 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
but 7 is not &lt; 5,
so that's false.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.812 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
And "true and false"
always gives us "false."

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:30.217 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
So the value of a
is now "false."

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:35.022 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
If I change this, though,
to an "or," is track &gt; 1

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:36.556 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:33%
or track &lt; 5?

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:42.896 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
Is 7 &gt; 1 or is 7 &lt; 5?
True or false.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.532 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
Well the value
of "true or false"

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:46.333 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
is always "true,"

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.168 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
because at least one of them
is true.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.671 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
So when I run that,
I get a value of "true."
