Professor: Let's look at how
to bring new audio files

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and new sound recordings
into EarSketch.

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
This is designed for short files
that you might want to use

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:12.112 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
with makeBeat() or fitMedia()
or other functions like that.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And there's a couple of ways
that you could do it.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.417 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
They're all accessible
from the Sound Browser,

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
so if your Sound Browser
isn't showing yet,

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:21.588 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
make sure to click on the icon
to make it show up

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:22.456 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
in the left side bar.

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:27.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And then click the blue ADD YOUR
OWN SOUND link

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:29.396 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
to add your own sounds.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:31.732 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now, there are two ways that you
can add sounds in EarSketch.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:34.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The first is that you can upload
an audio file

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.503 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that you already have
on your local computer.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.205 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So if I click the File Upload
button,

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:41.375 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I can choose a file in any
common audio format

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.478 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
like WAV, AIFF, or MP3.

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So I'll go ahead and choose
a file here.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And then I can give it a name,

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and that's the name that will
show up in the Sound Browser

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and that I’ll use that the sound
constant in EarSketch.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.392 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Also if you know the tempo
of it,

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.027 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
you should enter the tempo here
as well.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:03.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
That will enable EarSketch
to automatically scale the speed

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:06.199 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of playback of the audio file
based on the tempo

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.868 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
of any particular EarSketch
script

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that's been specified
with the setTempo() function

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.373 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
so this sound file will sync up
with all the other sounds

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that you're using in your music.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'll go ahead and upload this.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And now to find your sound file,

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
if you go to the Artists filter
Sound Browser

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.152 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you can see my username
is now showing up

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:26.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
as one of the artists.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.222 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And if pick that, you can see
the file I just uploaded.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.958 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And you can play it
and you can insert it

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.326 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
into your EarSketch scripts
the same way

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
that you would with any other
file from the Sound Browser.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Now, you can also record

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:41.001 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
your own sounds
directly inside of EarSketch.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.103 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And for that we use
the Quick Record button.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I can specify a tempo
I want to record at.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I can also specify a number
of measures I want to record.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.879 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So in this case I'm recording
two measures worth of audio,

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.881 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and I'm getting one measure
of the metronome

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
clicking first so that I know

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.819 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
exactly where the tempo is
before I start recording.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
[four electronic metronome
beats]

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:07.094 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
♪ This is a 2-measure
recording. ♫

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And now you can see the waveform
of the sound I recorded.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I can also listen back to it
to see if I like it.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.939 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And of course, I can give it
a constant name as well.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then I can upload that
as well.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
And now you see that showing up

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.415 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
under my artist name
in the Sound Browser as well.
