00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.103 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Instructor: Let's take a look
at the EarSketch user interface

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:05.239 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and all the components
of the EarSketch workspace.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.207 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I want to start
in the top right corner

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.610 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
where you can log in
with your username and password.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.778 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
If you don't have one yet,
make sure

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:13.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to register a new account.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.949 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Type in all of the information
so that you can log in.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.652 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I have an account already
so I'll go ahead and log in

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:21.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
with my information.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.423 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Another important thing
to look at on the top here

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.326 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
is this link called "Q&amp;A"
which takes you

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.629 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to a separate EarSketch
question and answer site

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:31.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
where you can ask and answer
questions about using EarSketch—

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.134 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and not just with other people
in your class,

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.837 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but with the whole
EarSketch community of users

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:39.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
from all around the world.

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:40.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Back to the main interface here.

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:42.542 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I want to look
at the left side here

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.144 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
where there's a bunch
of different icons

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.113 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
that open and close
different sections

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
of the user interface.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.782 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Let's start with the one
on the top—

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:49.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
the Sound Browser.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:53.787 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
This is where you can look
through 4,000 or so loops

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that are included with EarSketch
for you to use

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.624 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
inside of your music.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.259 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You can also add
your own sounds here

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.328 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
by recording them
inside of EarSketch

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:04.765 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or by uploading files
that you may already have.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
To find the sounds
that you're looking for,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
you can search for them.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:11.838 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But what I usually like to do
is to start off with a genre

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that I'm interested in
and then, from there,

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.709 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
look for the different
instruments that I want

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.711 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
to add to my mix.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:21.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Once you've found the things
that you're looking for

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
in a list here,
you can click on them

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
to preview them.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
[electric funk piano music]

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.725 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
You can view
some more information

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.361 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
by clicking the tags icon
and you can click the paste icon

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.797 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to paste the name of the sound
into the code

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:39.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
that you're writing.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.102 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Let's move on
to the Scripts Browser.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
When you're logged
into EarSketch

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.006 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and you're writing code
it automatically gets saved

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.841 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
to the cloud as you're writing.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.643 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
And this is where
you can view

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:51.378 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
all the different scripts
that you've created,

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:52.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
open them back up,

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.448 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and do different things
with them.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So I'll click on one
that I've created recently here—

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.852 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you can see
it immediately opens it

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:01.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
as a new tab in the Code Editor
here in the center of EarSketch.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.491 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
You can, of course, search
and sort your scripts as well,

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
but I really want to point out
this menu here

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
next to each script
where you can do

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
some more advanced things.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.398 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
You can download your script
as an audio file,

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:14.401 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
either a WAV or an MP3,
you can share your script

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.703 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to SoundCloud—
big social media site

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
for sharing music.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.208 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And you can also share it
as a URL that you can

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.176 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
cut and paste
onto any website you want.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.579 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You can even view
a history of your code—

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:26.913 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
you can look at all
the different changes

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.116 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you've made to it over time
and you can go back

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:31.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to an earlier version
if you don't like a new change

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
that you made.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So that's the Scripts Browser.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.089 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We move down
to the next icon here—

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.691 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
this is showing shared scripts,

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:39.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
scripts that have been
shared with me.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.627 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It's empty right now
but if you're looking

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:42.129 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
at a script that someone
has shared with you,

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.697 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
it'll show information
about that script

00:02:43.697 --> 00:02:45.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and some more options.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.701 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The final thing that we see
on the left side here,

00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.569 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
it's this next icon—
the API Browser.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.738 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This shows
all the special functions

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:54.508 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that we've added to Python
and JavaScript programming

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:56.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
languages to let you make music.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.012 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And so you can go through
and you can see the names

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.148 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of all the functions,
all the parameters they take.

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:02.783 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If you click on the eye icon
it gives you

00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:04.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
a lot more information
and some examples

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.552 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
of how to use them.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And again there's a paste button
if you want

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.622 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to paste that function
into the code

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.691 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
that you're writing.
So that's the left side bar.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I'm going to close that up
and let's look

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
at the middle now.

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I have a script open here.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So this is my code editor
where I can actually write

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.568 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and edit my code
and then I press the run button

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to actually run it
to make the music.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And when it's finished running
I'll see it in the top

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:29.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
here in the DAW,

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.745 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or the Digital Audio
Workstation, view.

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:34.147 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We'll talk more later
about exactly how this works

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
but you can see the music
track by track here

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.018 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and then I can play it as well.

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:42.089 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
[synth bass groove music]

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I can show and hide that
just like

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
all the other elements here.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Code Editor also has
some other options here—

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.132 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I can change
the background color

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:54.534 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
if it's easier for you to read
with a white background.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:59.573 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I can also change the font size
to make it bigger.

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And then down here
is the console—

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:04.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
that's this this icon.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.213 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
And the console shows me
information about the program

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:07.314 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
as its running.

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:09.983 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
It can show error messages
and warnings.

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.685 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
It can also show information.

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.054 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
Not just information
that EarSketch provides,

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:16.656 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
but also information
that you may actually choose

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.426 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
to put into the console
by putting print functions

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.595 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
inside of your code—
something that we'll cover

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.363 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
in a later chapter.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:24.931 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The final thing
that I want to show

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is the Curriculum,
which is all the way over here

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.334 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
on the right.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:29.903 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This little book icon hides it,
shows it.

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:31.505 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
That's probably
what you're reading right now

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to learn about EarSketch
and this is obviously

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
where you can continue reading
to learn more about writing code

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and making music with EarSketch.

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:40.614 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I want to point out
two things really quickly

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:42.349 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
about this.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
One is that there's
a lot of example code

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that comes
throughout the Curriculum.

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.121 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And with each of these
example code samples

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:52.526 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
you can press this paste icon
to open up that code

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:55.695 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
as a new tab in your Code Editor
so that you can then run it,

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
you can hear
what it sounds like,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.732 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and you can even edit it
and do more things

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
with it if you want.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The other thing I wanted to show
is that there's a lot of videos

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.406 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
like the one you're watching
right now inside

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of the Curriculum.

00:05:07.374 --> 00:05:09.543 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But they show up pretty small
most of the time,

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
so I suggest when you're
watching the videos

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.246 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that you hit
the little zoom icon,

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:14.781 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
at the bottom,
usually the bottom right

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
of the video,
which expands it

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:18.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
to a full screen view.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
One final thing that I want
to point out is

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.923 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that in EarSketch you can write
in one of two

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
programming languages—
either Python or JavaScript.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.161 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And you make the decision
about what language

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.763 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
you want to write in
whenever you create

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a new script in EarSketch.

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:33.533 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You can create a new script
by pressing the plus sign.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:36.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And you can see here
you then have the option

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.738 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of doing Python or JavaScript
and then you can also give

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
the name to your script.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.475 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So that concludes
our quick tour

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of the EarSketch user interface.
