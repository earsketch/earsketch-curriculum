Narrator:
So I'm here in Ableton Live,

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:05.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
one of the most popular DAWs
in the world,

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.775 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to show you a little bit more
about delay and how it works.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I have a reference sound
on track 1 of my DAW here,

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.780 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
which you can hear.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:22.189 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
[guitar melody with reverb]

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.026 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And I can add a delay effect
to that track.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And there's
a little yellow dot here

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
which sets the delay time.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.666 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
See right now,
it's set to 0.3 seconds,

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.801 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
so we'll hear
the original sound,

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and then 0.3 seconds later,
we'll hear a copy of that sound.

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:48.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
[guitar melody
with reverb and delay]

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.517 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Now of course I can
change that delay time.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.853 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
If I want the delayed version
to happen quicker,

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:57.758 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I can reduce that delay time,
say to 0.15 seconds. 

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:08.468 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[guitar melody
with reverb and quick delay]

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.772 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And that gives me
just one delayed copy,

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:13.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
but sometimes I might want
many delayed copies

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:16.009 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to have this recurring
echo happening.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.846 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
And so if I want that,
I can increase the feedback.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.649 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
And by setting
the delay feedback,

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:30.157 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
I can determine how these copies
continue over time.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.626 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
So we see here, our first copy
is still happening

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:41.201 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
after 0.15 seconds
at about 50 percent

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.869 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
of the original volume.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.008 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
And then after
another 0.15 seconds,

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
I get another copy
that's at 50 percent

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.145 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
of the volume of the last one.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.281 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
And then after
another 0.15 seconds,

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.383 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
I get another copy
that is half as loud

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:57.818 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
as the previous one,
and on and on

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
until the sound dies out.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:02.856 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
So every 0.15 seconds,
I get another delayed copy

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.992 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
that's quieter
than the previous one,

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:06.827 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
until they die out.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:14.101 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
[guitar melody
with reverb and quick delay]

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:18.405 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
And if I increase that feedback,
obviously, I'll hear a lot more

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.974 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
of those copies,
and they'll go on for longer.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.544 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
But they're still at that
same 0.15 second interval.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:30.751 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
[guitar melody
with reverb and loud delay]

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:39.526 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now sometimes I may want
to sync up the delay time

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:42.529 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
with the tempo of my song,
so that each of these delays

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
happens exactly on a beat.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
If I want to do that,
I need to do a little bit

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.039 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
of simple math to figure out
what my delay time should be.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So I know the tempo
of my song.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
In this case,
it's 120 beats per minute.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And then I also know
how many seconds

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:05.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
there are in a minute.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.191 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
There's 60 seconds in a minute.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:15.629 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So to figure out
how long my beat lasts,

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I simply say
that that equals to—

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:21.701 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
is equal to the number
of seconds in a minute

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:27.607 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
divided by the number
of beats per minute.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:32.579 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So that equals 60
divided by 120,

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.383 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
which equals 0.5 seconds.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.419 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And that's the number
I would put into my delay.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
A lot of music software,
including EarSketch,

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
though, asks for the time
in milliseconds

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.325 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
rather than in seconds.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.927 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So I need to do
one more conversion

00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to go from seconds
to milliseconds.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.366 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So the beat in milliseconds
would equal my beat

00:03:53.366 --> 00:04:01.274 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in seconds times 1000
because there are 1000

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:04.211 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
milliseconds in one second.

00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.448 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So the math here
would be 0.5 times 1000,

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:12.652 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which would
equal 500 milliseconds.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.688 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
And if we come back
to Ableton Live,

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.623 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
now here it's asking
for it in seconds,

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:19.893 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
but if I put this in
at 0.5 seconds

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:24.064 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
then every beat I will get
one copy of my delayed sound.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:33.273 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
[guitar melody with reverb
and a half-second delay]

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.842 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And you can hear how all
of those notes are lining up.
