00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:02.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Narrator: Let's go ahead
and use variables

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:05.072 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to make music in EarSketch.

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:08.008 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I have a JavaScript script here
which starts with

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.578 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the init() function,
initializing a new project

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.247 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
to make music in EarSketch.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.049 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And the setTempo() function
sets our tempo for the project.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.887 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
I'm going to slow that down
to 100 beats per minute.

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:22.289 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then the finish() function
at the end, which wraps

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.758 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
everything up and gets
the music ready for playback.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.427 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
In the middle here,
I'll define a variable.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I'll name this variable
"synth1," and I have

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.665 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
an assignment statement
here to assign

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
a particular value
to that variable.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.936 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And that value is going
to be a constant

00:00:35.936 --> 00:00:38.105 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
from the EarSketch
sound browser.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:41.642 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So I'm going to search
for a synth pluck sound here.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Use HIPHOP_SYNTHPLUCKLEAD_005.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.447 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I'll hit the paste button
there to paste that in.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.916 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Then I'll add a semi-colon.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:53.287 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And so this has
assigned the sound,

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
HIPHOP_SYNTHPLUCKLEAD_005,
to the variable synth1.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.928 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So now that I've defined synth1
and I've assigned it that value,

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:03.997 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I can go ahead and use
a fitmedia() function

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.666 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
to actually use the variable.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.267 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
So I'll use the sound synth1.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
I'll have this be on track 1,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.206 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
starting at measure 1
and ending in measure 2.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:16.109 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And again, I'll add
this semi-colon at the end.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Now I can press run.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:24.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
[synth melody]

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:27.087 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So we heard one measure
of this sound stored

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.124 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in the variable synth1
on track 1, from measure 1 to 2.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now that I've defined
one variable, I can go ahead

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:34.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and I can define more.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:36.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
So I'll define
a second variable.

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:38.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I'll call it "synth2."

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:44.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And I will give this
another synth sound,

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.007 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
this HIPHOP_SOLOMOOGLEAD_001.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.042 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
So now I've assigned the value,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
HIPHOP_SOLOMOOGLEAD_001,
to the variable synth2.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.849 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And I can do the same thing
with a drum sound.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I will name my variable "drums."

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:04.992 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And I will assign this
HIPHOP_TRAPHOP_BEAT_008

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
to my drums variable.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And now I can go ahead,
and I can put in a bunch

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:15.469 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
of fitmedia() calls where each
of those references

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.005 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
a different variable
of those three.

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:22.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So I have here synth1, synth2,
synth2, synth1, synth2,

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:25.879 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
synth1, synth2, and finally
drums at the end.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.548 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
You see each of these—
all the synth1s are going

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.718 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
on to track 1
on successive measures.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:34.154 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So the first one goes
from measure one to two,

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.456 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the next one from two to three,
the next one, three to four.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.059 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Four to five is left empty,
and then five to six

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and so on and so forth.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
My drums sound
is going on track two,

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.799 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and it's taking up
all of track two.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.501 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So from measure one
to measure nine,

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
because I want the drums
to be going on during

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.405 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
the entire song here.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:54.641 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So now I can go ahead
and press run again

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.643 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and hear what I've got.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:03:17.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
[synth hip-hop beat]

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:18.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Now what if I wanted
to experiment with

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.301 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
a different sound for synth1?

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.769 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
If I wanted to change that.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.605 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
What would happen
if I wanted a different

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
synth pluck sound?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Instead of 005, maybe 006.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Well because
I'm using variables,

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:33.046 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I only have to change
this in one place

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in the assignment statement.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So I just changed it
from 5 to 6 here,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.785 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and any place I'm using
synth1 down here,

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
any of these other spots

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.022 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
will automatically update
with the new sound.

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:43.356 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
So I can hear
what this sounds like,

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.058 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
see if I like it better,
or maybe I don't

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
like it as much.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:04:08.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
[modified electronic
hip-hop beat]

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:12.619 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And this ties into
a really important concept

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in making music called
"iterative design."

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:18.091 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And the notion behind
iterative design is that

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.694 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you don't just kind of
put something out there

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.462 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and then say you're done.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.965 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You start
with something that's okay.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:28.068 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And you listen to it,
and you think about

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:29.936 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
how you might be able
to make it better.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And you make some changes.
You listen to it again.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.407 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
You think about how you might
be able to make it better.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You keep on experimenting,
making changes.

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.112 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Sometimes it may make it worse,
and you might undo them.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.814 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Sometimes they may
make them better

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:41.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and you keep them.

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:44.017 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
But you keep on doing this
over and over and over again,

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
until you end up with music
that's really, really awesome.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.324 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And variables are
a really important part

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:54.094 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
of making this happen
in EarSketch, because

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:57.664 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
you may have a song
where you have dozens

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.032 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of different sounds
that you're using

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.067 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
hundreds of different times
and functions like

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:02.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
fitmedia() in your script.

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:05.172 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And if you had to go
through every time you wanted

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:07.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to experiment with a new sound
and find every time

00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.277 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you were using the old sound
and update that constant

00:05:10.277 --> 00:05:12.879 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to the new sound,
that would take you forever.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
But if you use variables,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.715 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you only have to
change it in one place.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:18.318 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Even if you use it
a hundred or five hundred times

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.153 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in your song,
it will automatically update.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.788 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
As long change that
assignment statements,

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
everything below it will
update automatically,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
whenever you've referenced
that variable.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:29.095 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And so it makes it
a lot easier to experiment,

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to try out new things
very quickly,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.999 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to see what works,
to see what doesn't,

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and to make your music
really awesome.
