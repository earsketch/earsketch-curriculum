\f0\fs24 \cf0 Professor: EarSketch, like most programming environments, has a console that can show us information about the state of our program. We can use the console to help us debug all different kinds of errors. And in this video, we\'92ll look at how to use the console to debug syntax errors. We have a short script here, which has four syntax errors in it. Pause the video for a minute and see if you can find all four. \
Okay, now let\'92s use the console to help us find and fix those four syntax errors. \
We can see immediately two red \'93x\'92s\'94 that are showing up in the code editor. Those are showing us console messages before we even have to hit the run button and look for them. So if I move my mouse over that first red \'93x\'94 here, we can see the first console message. It says, \'93Expected end parentheses and instead saw semicolon.\'94 \
And if we look at this line 14 here, we can see setTempo(), beginning parentheses, 120, semicolon. We\'92re missing the end parentheses. If I add that in, that red \'93x\'94 immediately goes away and I\'92ve fixed one of my syntax errors. Now let\'92s look at line 17 and see what that red \'93x\'94 says. It says, \'93Expected end parentheses and instead saw one.\'94 So if we look here, we can see there is a sound file constant and the number 1 indicating that the sound is going to go on track 1. There\'92s no comma in between the two of them, and so that is why the computer got confused. So if I add a semicolon in there, again another syntax error and that second red \'93x\'94 has gone away. \
So we\'92ve found two of the syntax errors now, but there\'92s two more. How do we find those? Well for that, we need to actually run the script. And when I hit the run button, I\'92ll see another error message show up down here in the console. The console always appears underneath the Code Editor. If for some reason you don\'92t see it, you can toggle it on and off using this icon up here. \
So let\'92s read this console message. It says, \'93EarSketch scripts must consist of init(), setTempo(), and finish() functions.\'94 Well I see init() here, and I see setTempo() there. I don\'92t see finish() here. So let\'92s add finish() to the end. And I\'92ll hit run again. \
And now we have one more error message. It says \'93ReferenceError\'97 There is an error with a variable or function name that is not defined.\'94 And it tells what is not defined. It says it is fitMedia(). And if we look here at fitMedia(), we can see one very subtle issue with it. We\'92re using a lowercase \'93m,\'94 but the EarSketch fitMedia() function uses an uppercase \'93M.\'94 This is a very common problem with syntax errors when programming using either the incorrect spelling or incorrect capitalization of a function name or a variable name. So I\'92ve changed that lowercase \'93m\'94 to a capital \'93M.\'94 I can hit run one more time. And now I\'92ve fixed all four syntax errors, and I can see the music in the DAW and listen to it. \
