Instructor: Let's use these
debugging techniques to find

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:06.406 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and fix the bug in this script.

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.475 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
This script defines
a variable, "beat,"

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.278 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which is beatString(),
and defines another variable

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:13.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
"sound" and assigns it

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.215 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a sound constant from
the EarSketch sound library.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.485 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It then as a for loop,
which calls makeBeat()

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
eight times to use that sound
and that beatString() to repeat

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.527 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the beat string eight times
in a row on track 1 of the DAW.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This all sounds great
but when I press

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:32.633 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the run button, I immediately
get an error on line 22.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And the error messages says,

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:37.204 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
"RangeError: A provided
argument is not within

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:41.341 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
"the set or range of acceptable
values for a function."

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.644 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So if I don't know
what that means right away,

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:47.748 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the best thing I can try first
is to use the prinln() function

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.517 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
in JavaScript to find out
what's going on

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
inside of this for loop.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:55.022 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
And it says that the problem
is with a provided argument,

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:58.125 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
so why don't I go ahead
and print out the values of all

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.793 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
the arguments to makeBeat.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:07.701 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
So I can go println(sound),
println(measure),

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.737 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
and println(beat).

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:14.041 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
And then I can press run again
and I can see what happens.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.077 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
Well "sound" is
this sound constant

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.213 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
so that seems to be okay.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:25.018 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
"Measure" is 0 and "beat"
is the beatString().

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.854 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
So the beatString()
and the "sound" seem to be okay.

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:31.792 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
If I look more closely
at "measure" and think about it,

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:34.494 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
realize that EarSketch
always starts at measure 1.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.698 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
There is no such thing
as measure 0 in EarSketch.

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.667 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
So let's focus in
on that for a minute.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.402 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
I'm going to delete
println(beat).

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.172 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
I'm going to delete
println(sound) so we can

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:47.708 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
focus just on printing out
our "measure" values.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.378 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
And I'm going to comment out
this makeBeat() function call

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:53.146 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
so that the entire
for loop will work.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:56.216 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
I won't get any errors,
hopefully, but I'll just see

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.451 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
what the value
of "measure" is

00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
every time I go
through the loop.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
And when I do that
I can see that "measure"

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.593 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.997 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
So it's repeating 8 times
but from 0 to 7 instead

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:13.133 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
of from 1 to 8 the way
that I wanted it to.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So if I look back
at the declaration of for loop

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.638 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
here I can see we start
by initializing "measure" to 0.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.107 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
I can change that to 1.

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:22.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
I can press run again.

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.311 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That fixes part of it
because now we get

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:29.116 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
so I'm not trying to put

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:31.451 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
music on measure 0 anymore
but it's also

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.953 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
only repeating seven times.

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:34.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I never get up to measure 8.

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:36.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
That's because of the stopping
condition here, measure &lt; 8.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:39.826 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
We want that to be measure &lt; 9
so that it will actually go

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
through the for loop
for the number 8

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.064 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and not stop when it gets to 8.

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:47.768 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So if I now press run
one more time I can see we have

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:51.104 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8—

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.874 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
the eight times that we
go through the for loop.

00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:56.643 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So now I think I can go ahead
and uncomment the makeBeat()

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.012 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
function call, so it will
actually put the music

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in the DAW and create
a rhythm that we can hear.
