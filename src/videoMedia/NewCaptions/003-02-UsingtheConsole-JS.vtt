Professor:
EarSketch, like most

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:05.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
programming environments,
has a console that can show us

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:08.508 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
information about
the state of our program.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.344 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We can use the console
to help us debug

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:11.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
all different kinds of errors.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.714 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And in this video,
we’ll look at how to use

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
the console to debug
syntax errors.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
We have a short script here,

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:20.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
which has four
syntax errors in it.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.189 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Pause the video
for a minute and see

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
if you can find all four.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.163 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Okay, now let’s use
the console to help us find

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
and fix those four
syntax errors.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
We can see immediately

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
two red X’s that are
showing up in the code editor.

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:43.076 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Those are showing us
console messages before we even

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.945 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
have to hit the Run button
and look for them.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.249 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So if I move my mouse
over that first red X here,

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we can see
the first console message.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:54.054 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It says,
“Expected end parenthesis

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:55.555 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and instead saw semicolon.”

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.593 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And if we look at this line
14 here, we can see setTempo(),

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:02.663 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
beginning parenthesis,
120, semicolon.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:04.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
We’re missing
the end parenthesis.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
If I add that in,
that red X immediately

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
goes away and I’ve fixed
one of my syntax errors.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:14.141 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Now, let’s look at line 17
and see what that red X says.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:16.576 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It says,
“Expected end parenthesis

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.513 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and instead saw 1.”

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:22.616 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So if we look here,
we can see there is

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:26.186 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
a sound file constant
and the number 1 indicating

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.322 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that the sound is going
to go on track 1.

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
There’s no comma in between
the two of them,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.229 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and so that is why
the computer got confused.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.432 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So if I add
a semicolon in there,

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
again, I've fixed another syntax
error

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.303 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and that second red X
has gone away.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.906 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So we’ve found two
of the syntax errors now,

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
but there’s two more.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.308 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
How do we find those?

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.978 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Well, for that, we need
to actually run the script.

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:54.014 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And when I hit the Run button,
I’ll see another error message

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:56.316 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
show up down here
in the console.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.952 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The console always appears
underneath the Code Editor.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
If for some reason
you don’t see it,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.391 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you can toggle it on and off
using this icon up here.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:05.892 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So let’s read
this console message.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.762 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It says, “EarSketch scripts
must consist of init(),

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:10.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
setTempo(),
and finish() functions.”

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Well, I see init() here,
and I see setTempo() there.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I don’t see finish() here.

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:18.438 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So let’s add finish()
to the end.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.306 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
And I’ll hit Run again.

00:02:19.306 --> 00:02:24.211 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And now we have
one more error message.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
It says “ReferenceError—
There is an error

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.449 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with a variable or function name
that is not defined.”

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.951 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And it tells
what is not defined.

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:32.886 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
It says it is fitMedia().

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.388 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And if we look here
at fitMedia(),

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:37.891 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we can see one very subtle
issue with it.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
We’re using a lowercase m,
but the EarSketch

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
fitMedia() function
uses an uppercase M.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.266 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
This is a very common problem
with syntax errors

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:49.136 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
when programming using
either the incorrect spelling

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.637 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
or incorrect capitalization

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.173 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of a function name
or a variable name.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.641 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
So I’ve changed
that lowercase m

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.642 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
to a capital M.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I can hit Run one more time.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.546 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And now I’ve fixed
all four syntax errors,

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:02.582 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and I can see the music
in the DAW and listen to it.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:07.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
