00:00:00.334 --> 00:00:02.302 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Instructor: Now let's look
at a script that uses

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:04.771 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
two different for loops
in two different ways.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It starts the usual way,
importing the EarSketch library,

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:11.612 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
init(), set tempo to 130 bpm,
and defining

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:13.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
four different variables
that represent

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.749 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
four different sounds
from the EarSketch library.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.453 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And here's our first for loop
for measure in range 1 to 9.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:22.956 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It has two fitMedia() calls
inside of the for loop.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And the goal here is
for the first fitMedia()

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
function call to place
one drum sound

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
on the first half
of each measure,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.066 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and a second fitMedia() call
to place a different drum sound

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
on the second half
on each measure.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So to figure out more
about how this is working,

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
let's plot out
exactly what happens.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.043 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So our loop counter measure
is set to 1,

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.713 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.248 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And when it gets to 9,
the loop stops,

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.918 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
so it's never set to 9.

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:54.054 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Now the first fitMedia() call
places the sound "drums1"

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
on track 1 for measure
to measure+0.5.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So let's figure out
what measure+0.5 is

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
on each iteration of the loop.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
The first time is 1.5.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:07.267 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So it's placing the sound
from 1 to 1.5.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:09.236 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That's the first half
of measure 1.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.039 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The second time,
it's from 2 to 2.5,

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the first half of measure 2.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:16.777 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The third time from 3 to 3.5,
the first half of measure 3.

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:21.882 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Then 4 to 4.5,
5 to 5.5, and so on.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:25.852 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now the second fitMedia() call
places the "drums2" sound

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:29.423 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
on track 2 starting
at measure+0.5

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and ending at measure+1.

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:35.362 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So the first iteration loop,
that'll go from 1.5 to 2—

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.664 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
in other words,
the second half of measure 1—

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.933 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and ending at the very beginning
of measure 2.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:44.538 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The next time from 2.5 to 3,
so the second half of measure 2

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ending at the beginning
of measure 3.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.143 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
The next time,
from 3.5 to 4,

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:52.379 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
so that's the second half
of measure 3

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:55.048 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ending at the beginning
of measure 4.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:59.419 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And then from 4.5 to 5,
from 5.5 to 6,

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:00.487 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and so on and so forth.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.856 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
And if you look
at the DAW view,

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.624 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
you could see exactly
how this happens.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
How all of those
first fitMedia() calls

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.096 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
are always putting
the drum sounds

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.697 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
on the first half
of each measure,

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:14.701 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and all of the second set
of fitMedia() calls are placing

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.104 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
the different drums sound
on the second half

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:19.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
of each measure.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Now down here there's
two additional fitMedia() calls—

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.378 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
these aren't part
of any for loop—

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.346 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
that are simply placing
guitar and synth sounds

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
on tracks 3 and 4.

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The guitar sound comes in
starting at the very beginning

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.684 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
of measure 1.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The synth sound doesn't
come in until measure 5.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.522 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And you can see that
in the DAW view as well,

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
looking at tracks 3 and 4.

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.028 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Now let's look
at the last for loop here,

00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:43.563 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which controls
the panning of each track.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.166 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Now panning is simply a way
of controlling how much

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.868 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
a track sounds
in the left speaker

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
versus the right speaker

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
or the left ear of
your headphones

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.572 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
versus the right ear
of your headphones.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:57.277 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We use it with a constant PAM
parameter named "LEFT_RIGHT,"

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and the minimum value
we can assign it is -100,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.381 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
which is all the way
in the left speaker.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.251 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
The maximum value of +100,
all the way

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:04.985 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
in the right speaker.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.721 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So here's some examples
of calls to setEffect().

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.858 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The first will set the panning
for track one to -100,

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
all the way in the left speaker.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.562 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
The second example here
sets the panning

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:16.963 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
for track 4 to 0.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:21.835 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
That's right in the center,
halfway between left and right.

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:25.238 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The third example sets
the panning for track 2 to +100,

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.407 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
all the way
in the right speaker.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.877 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Now let's look
at the for loop here.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Our loop counter is track,
so we're iterating across track

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
"for track in range 1 to 5,"
and inside

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.719 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
each iteration for loop,
we're setting a pan amount,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.822 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and I'll get into this equation
in a second.

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:44.825 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then we're setting
the effect for that track,

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:48.328 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the PAN, LEFT_RIGHT, value
to the panAmount variable

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:49.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
that we just calculated.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.699 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
So again let's try to use
a table to keep track

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.936 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
of what these values are
in each iteration of the loop.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.205 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
So the track,
the loop counter track,

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:01.341 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
is set to 1 then 2
then 3 and then 4.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:03.076 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
And when it gets
to 5 the loop stops,

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.878 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
so it's never set to 5.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:07.848 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
Now in this panAmount equation,
one of the things

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:09.516 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
it's using is track minus 1.

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.051 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
So let's calculate that first.

00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:14.988 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
So 1 minus 1 is 0.
2 minus 1 is 1.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:18.592 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
3 minus 1 is 2.
4 minus 1 is 3.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.627 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
Now let's look
at the whole equation.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:22.362 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:41%
The first time
we come through,

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:25.832 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
it's 200 times zero—
that's track minus 1

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.068 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
divided by 3 minus 100.

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:32.439 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
So 200 times 0 is 0.
0 divided by 3 is still 0.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.908 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
0 minus 100 is -100.

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:38.378 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
So track 1 gets panned
all the way to the left.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:41.214 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
The next time through,
it's going to be 200

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
times 1 divided by 3
minus 100.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.355 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
So 200 times 1 is 200,
divided by 3 is about 66,

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:51.391 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
minus 100
is going to be about -33.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
So a little bit to the left.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.663 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
The next time through,
it'll be 200 times 2,

00:04:56.663 --> 00:05:00.133 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
divided by 3, minus 100,
which is going to be

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.102 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
a little bit to the right, +33.

00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:05.472 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
And the final time,
it will be 200 times 3,

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.073 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
divided by 3, minus 100.

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:10.977 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
200 times 3, divided by 3,
is just 200.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.979 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
200 minus 100 is 100.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.849 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
So it will be panned
all the way to the right.

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.684 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And we can see that
if we look at the DAW view.

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.786 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We can see
that track 1's panning

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:23.623 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
is all the way to the bottom,
it's minus 100, hard left.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:27.994 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Then -33, +33, and then +100.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.463 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And when we listen to this,
we can hear the panning

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:31.998 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
and we can hear
how each track

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:36.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
seems to be in a different place
in a left-right stereo space.

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:51.351 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
