00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Instructor: So now
let's look at a script

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:06.006 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that uses two different
for loops in two different ways.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.809 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
It starts in the usual way:
init(), setTempo()

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.979 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and defining four different
variables to represent

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.081 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
four different sounds
we'll be using

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
throughout our script.

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Here's the first "for" loop:

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:22.122 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
"for (var measure = 1;
measure &lt;9; measure++)."

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So the goal of this "for" loop
is for each measure

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.728 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
that it's iterating through
with these two different

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:30.931 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
fitMedia() function calls,
to put one drum sound

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
on the first half of each
of those measures

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and a different drum sound
on the second half

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
of each of those measures.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.872 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
To figure out more
about how it's working,

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.141 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
let's build a little table
that keeps track

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.243 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of what's happening
on each iteration

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of the "for" loop.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:49.917 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So the measure variable
first equals 1, then 2,

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
then 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
The loop stops
when it gets to 9.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.892 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And the first fitMedia()
call places the sound

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
drums1 on track1

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.397 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
from measure to measure
plus 0.5.

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.499 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
So in other words,
the first iteration

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.367 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
goes from one to 1.5.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.236 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
That's the first half
of measure 1.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.238 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
The next time,
from 2 to 2.5,

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that's the first half
of measure 2.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Then 3 to 3.5, 4 to 4.5,
and so on and so forth.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.982 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The second fitMedia()
function call puts

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
a different sound, drums2,
on track 2,

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:29.489 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
starting at "measure + 0.5"
and ending in "measure +1."

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:33.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So in the first iteration,
that'll be from 1.5 to 2.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.395 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
That's from halfway
through measure 1

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to the start of measure 2.

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:39.866 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
The next times goes
from 2.5 to 3,

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.436 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
starting from halfway through
measure 2,

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.538 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ending at the beginning
of measure 3.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.873 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
Next time, from 3.5 to 4,

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the next time 4.5 to 5,
and so on.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.713 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
It may be easier actually
to just look at this

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:54.781 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in the DAW view
to see what's happening

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.583 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
as a result
of this loop executing.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Each measure we can see
one drum sound ending up

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.721 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
on the first half
of each measure.

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And the other sound
from the second fitMedia() call,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
ending up
on the second half

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
of each measure.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.730 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
After this "for" loop there's
two more fitMedia() calls.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
These aren't part of any loop.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.034 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
They're simply putting
the guitar and synth sounds

00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:15.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
on tracks 3 and 4.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.038 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The guitar sound
starts at measure 1.

00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:20.407 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The synth sound doesn't start
until measure 5.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And again, if we go back
to the DAW view

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.979 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you can see this clearly
looking at tracks 3 and 4.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.348 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Now I want to move
on to the second

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
"for" loop here,
which is setting

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:32.753 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
the panning on each
of these tracks.

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.755 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
Now panning
is a simple way

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:37.724 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of setting how much
a track's sound

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.493 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
is coming through
the left speaker versus

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.795 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
the right speaker,
or your left headphone ear

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.463 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
versus your right
headphone ear.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:46.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
In EarSketch, we use
the constant "PAN"

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
for the pan effect
and the parameter

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:50.237 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
"LEFT_RIGHT."

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:53.206 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And when we set it to -100,
that's the lowest value

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:54.908 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
we can set it to,
which means send it

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
all out of the left speaker.

00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:59.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
We set it to +100,
that's the maximum value

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.748 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
if we say send it
all out of the right speaker.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:05.185 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And here's a few example
function calls to setEffect().

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Here in this first one,
we're setting panning

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
for track 1 to -100.

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.991 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
So we're sending
track 1 entirely

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
to the left speaker.

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.695 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The second example here,
we're setting track 4 to 0,

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
that's center PAN.

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:19.066 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
In other words,
evenly distributed

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:20.333 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
to the left and to the right.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.303 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And the final example here,
we're setting the panning

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:26.673 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for track 2 to +100,
so that's going all the way

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.475 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
to the right speaker.

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.911 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Now let's come back
and look at this loop.

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Inside the loop—
well first of all,

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.348 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
our loop variable is track.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:40.287 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
So "for track = 1 while
track &lt;5, track ++,"

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:42.823 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we're setting
the panAmount each time

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:44.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
we go through this loop.

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.626 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
How much do we want
that track to be panned

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:47.861 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to the left or the right?

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.764 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And then we're calling
setEffect() for that track

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:53.033 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and setting it
to the given panAmount.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.836 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
So again, let's build
a little table to keep

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.705 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
track of exactly
what's going on here.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
Our loop variable track

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.677 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
is set to 1, then 2,
then 3, and then 4.

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:06.279 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
And when it gets to 5,
the loop stops.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:11.184 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Then, the panAmount equation
here references "(track - 1)."

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
So let's track what that is
each time we go through.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.157 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
First time,
track-1 = 1-1, or zero.

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
The next time, it's equal
to 2-1, that's 1.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.896 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
Next time 3-1, so it's 2.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:26.233 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
The final time 4-1, so it's 3.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.968 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
Now let's look
at that entire equation.

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:31.805 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
The first time the loop executes
it's 200 times 0

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.307 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
divided by 3 minus 100.
200 times 0 is 0.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:38.645 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
Zero divided by three,
still zero.

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.181 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
Zero minus 100,
minus 100.

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:43.917 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
So track 1 therefore,
gets set at PAN value

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:46.953 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
of -100, all the way
to the left speaker.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
The next time it executes
it's 200 times 1

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.259 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
divided by 3 minus 100.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.796 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
So 200 times 1 is 200,
200 divided by 3 is about 66,

00:04:56.796 --> 00:05:00.233 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
66 minus 100 is about
negative 33.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:01.801 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
So it's getting
panned a little bit

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.737 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
to the left this time.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
The next time we go through
it's 200 times 2

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.508 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
divided by 3 minus 100.

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:11.111 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
So that's going to be
about positive 33

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.579 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
or a little bit to the right.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:14.915 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
And the final time,
it's 200 times 3

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:17.184 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
divided by 3 minus 100.

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:20.353 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
Well 200 times 3 divided by 3
is just 200.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.723 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
Then 200 minus 100 is 100,

00:05:23.723 --> 00:05:25.592 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
so it's panned all the
way to the right.

00:05:25.592 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And again, if we look
at the DAW view here,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
we can see track 1
panned all the way

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.134 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to the left, minus 100,
here track two negative 33,

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:38.672 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
