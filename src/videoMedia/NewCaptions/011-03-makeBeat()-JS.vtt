00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.503
[intro music]

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:08.242
Hello. Welcome to another
EarSketch video.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.712
My name is Takumi, and I'm
a member of the EarSketch team.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.348
In this video I will talk
about how to use makeBeat

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.416
to create an original beat.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.019
Now that we learn about strings,
beat strings,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.288
and EarSketch’s
makeBeat function,

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.590
let's make some music
using these.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.159
makeBeat allows you
to compose music note by note.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.329
So it is perfect
for creating new drum beats.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.398
Think you have
the next radio-ready beat?

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.733
Let's get started.

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.735
Let's start off by defining
some variables

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:37.604
for the sounds that we are
going to use in this script.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.375
We'll call the first one "synth"
and we'll be looking for a clip

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.543
in the sound browser
the same way we usually do

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:47.281
for fitMedia
in the EarSketch sound browser.

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.549
We can either search
through the list

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.353
or search by genre or artists.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.623
In this code example, let's look
for a filtered chord sound.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:00.427
[music]

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:04.131
Cool, let's use this one.
So we’ll paste that in.

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.033
For the second sound,
a cymbal,

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.502
we’ll do this
in a slightly different way.

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:10.037
We're going to look
for a special kind of sound

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:14.074
in the EarSketch song library
called a one-shot sound file.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.943
All the sounds that we have
been using up to now

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:21.048
are loops that last for 1,
2, 3, or 4 measures.

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:23.784
But one-shot sound file
is just a single hit.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.586
For example,
a single hit of a drum sound.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.189
In this case it is a cymbal.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.824
This type of sound
is especially useful

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:35.162
when using a makeBeat call for
building rhythm or drum pattern.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.464
Once your sounds are located
in a special place

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.334
inside of the EarSketch
sound library.

00:01:40.334 --> 00:01:43.637
If you go to the Artists
filter here and pick makeBeat,

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:47.174
then we’ll find
all the one-shot sound files.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:50.777
So if you played a clap,
we'll simply get a single clap.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.112
[clap]

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:56.950
If you play the high hat here,
we get a single high hat sound.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.520
Let's paste that into the script
for our cymbal sound.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.922
Just like how
we can define variable

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:04.391
to represent a sound
from the library,

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.627
we can define a variable
to represent beat string.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:12.132
So we’ll first define a beat1
and as you may remember,

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:16.370
a string for beat string
are 16 character letters long,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.907
which represent a total of
16 individual sixteenth notes.

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.110
These make up one full measure
of a beat.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.880
And if you don't know how to get
started on creating a beat,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.448
don't worry.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.852
You can randomly put zero,
plus signs, and negative signs,

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:33.954
and listen to it
and start adjusting

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:35.722
or changing little by little

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.625
until you create a beat
that you like.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.131
Here's the rhythm that I came up
with using that technique.

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:48.435
Da da da da da da da da.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.872
Here's another beat string
that I came up with.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:57.244
Da da da da da da da da.

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:58.845
So we define our sounds

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.649
and we define our beat strings
as variables,

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:06.686
so we are now ready to use
these in the makeBeat function.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:10.791
The first argument in makeBeat
is the sound

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:15.495
that we want to use,
so we use the synth variable.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.164
The second argument
is the track.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:20.767
So we'll begin with 1.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.202
The third argument
is the measure

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:27.307
in which the beat starts at
and we’ll start from measure 1.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:32.145
The final argument is the beat
string, so we'll use beat1.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:36.683
We can go ahead and hit Run
to hear what this sounds like.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.719
[music]

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:47.027
We'll do something similar
with cymbal rhythm.

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:50.564
First argument will be cymbal.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:56.136
Second argument is 2.
Third argument is 1.

00:03:56.136 --> 00:04:01.675
And final argument is beat2.
Now let's listen to it together.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.315
[music]

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:10.350
Now, you may have noticed
that the beat plays

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.152
for only one measure.

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:14.955
In music, beats are usually
repeated multiple times

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:16.690
or looped in a song.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.326
So we need to figure out
an efficient way to loop

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:22.195
to speed
that we've just created.

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.865
If we wanted to play this
for more than one time,

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:26.700
we could just copy this line

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.970
and type 2
for the measure arguments

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.740
and repeat the process
multiple times like this.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:39.479
And now when we hit Run,
we have a repeating beat.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:49.289
[music]

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.492
The problem with this method
is that it takes a lot of time

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:55.095
and makes the code
look really messy.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:57.464
In the next chapter, we'll learn
a new coding technique

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.432
that will allow you
to easily repeat

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:02.335
or loop part of your code
to achieve repetition,

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:04.704
while keeping your code
looking clean.

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.039
Thanks for watching.

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.041
