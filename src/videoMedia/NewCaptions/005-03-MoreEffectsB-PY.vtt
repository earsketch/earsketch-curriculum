Professor: Now, let’s look
at how to use volume

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.205 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and filter effects
inside of EarSketch,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.542 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
along with setEffect()
and effect envelopes.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:09.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I have a Python script here.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Beginning by importing
the EarSketch library,

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.680 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
I call the init() function.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I call the setTempo() function

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.551 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to set the tempo to 120 beats
per minute.

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then I have a fitMedia()
function call here

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:23.991 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
placing this sound on track 1
beginning at measure 1,

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.459 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
ending at the start
of measure 9.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:28.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
That gives me some sound
on track 1 that I have

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
as a bass sound that I can then
add effects to.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So let’s hear the original sound
without any effects.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:43.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
[electronic musical scales
ascending and descending]

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.712 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Now,
to make things easier,

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.715 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I am going to define some
variables that represent

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.686 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
different measures in the music
where I want to start or end

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
different effects envelopes,

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so that it’s easier to refer
to them multiple times

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
or to change them later.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
So I have pointA,
B, C,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.062 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
D, E,
and F all defined here.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.264 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
PointA is the beginning
of measure 1.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
PointB the beginning
of measure 4.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.936 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
PointC is halfway
between the start of measure 6

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.938 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and the start of measure 7.

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:12.606 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
PointD,
the start of measure 7.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:15.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
PointE, halfway
between the start of measure 8

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.144 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and the start of measure 9.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:19.746 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And pointF is the beginning
of measure 9.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:23.116 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And then I’m going to add
a setEffect() call here

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.485 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
on track 1, since it’s the only
track I have sound on.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:27.087 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
The effect will be FILTER

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and the parameter of that effect
I’m changing

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:32.759 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
is the filter frequency—so
how bright or dark the sound is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.561 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that I’m allowing to stay
in the mix.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:39.633 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And then this is going from
PointA—that’s measure 1—

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:42.102 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
to pointB, 
the start of measure 4.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.205 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So between the start of measure
1 and the start of measure 4,

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:47.474 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I’m changing that filter
frequency from 20 hertz,

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.309 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
which is the lowest it could
possibly be,

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:51.545 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
all the way up to 10,000 hertz,

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.481 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
which is about halfway
where it can get you.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The maximum is 20,000 hertz.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
So if I hit run now,

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.555 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
we can see the envelope
here—starting at 20 hertz

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:02.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
at the start of measure 1,

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:07.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
going up until it gets to 10,000
hertz at the start of measure 4.

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:09.062 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And we can hear that filter
sweep now,

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
as we listen to the music.

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:20.974 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
[electronic musical scales
ascending and descending]

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:26.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So now, let’s add some envelopes
for our volume.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:30.917 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The first one here is a fade-in
that we can put at the beginning

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
of the music, going
from -10 decibels

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
to zero—so that’s the original
volume—from pointB to pointC,

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
so measure 4 to measure 6.5.

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:44.498 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So if I run this,
we can see that at measure 4

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
we’re at -10 decibels.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
By the time we get
to measure 6.5,

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:51.138 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
we’re up to 0 decibels.

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then if I look at the next
line here,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
I’m going to start to do
a fade-out,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.178 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
starting at pointD,
measure 7,

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
through to pointE,
measure 8.5,

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:05.552 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
going from 0dB—the original
volume—back down to -10dB.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:09.756 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So we can see the next part
of that fade coming down here.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And then finally, I want to have

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.727 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a last bit that’s a bit
of a faster fade-out,

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.497 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
at the very end from measure 8.5
to 9— that last half a measure

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:22.769 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from pointE, from -10dB
all the way down to -60dB,

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.804 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
which is silence,

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:25.839 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
so that it has that quick
fade-out at the end.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And you can see that last part
of the envelope comes on now—

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.644 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
we have that quick fade-out
at the very end.

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:34.815 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So now we can hear
the whole piece of music

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:38.952 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
with the filter sweep and with
the fade-ins and the fade-outs.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:54.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
