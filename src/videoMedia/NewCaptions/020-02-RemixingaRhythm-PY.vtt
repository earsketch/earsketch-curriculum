Instructor: The Amen break
is a four measure long

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.039 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
drum break that was
originally recorded

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:09.509 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
in the 1960s and has
become one of the most

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:15.449 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
often remixed and sampled
drum beats in all time.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Now we're going to recreate it
in EarSketch and then

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.521 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
we're going to remix it
in EarSketch.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:25.325 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So the code I have here
recreates the Amen break.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I'm using makeBeat
and I have a list of drum sounds

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.598 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
here from the EarSketch
sound library:

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
kick, snare,
and three different hi-hats.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And then I've broken up
the beat string here

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
since it's four measures long—
that's 64 characters.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.476 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So I've broken it up
into different parts.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:45.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
I have an "a," "b," and "c" part
for the kick and snare

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.514 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
and then a cym1,
cym2, and cym3 part

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
for the hi-hat sounds.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:52.753 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And the reason I did that
is to make it more readable

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.955 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but also because
there's some repetition

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.924 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
built into the Amen Break,
so I can use

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
string concatenation
to help make that clear.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.399 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So amenBreak = a + a,
there's my repetition, + b + c.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Then we get the same
repetition with the cymbals,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
cym1 + cym1,

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:11.805 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
so there's my repetition,
+ cym2 + cym3.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Then I have two makeBeat()
function calls placing

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.612 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
the two different beat strings
on tracks one and two of my DAW.

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:20.981 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And we can listen to what
the amenBreak sounds like.

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:28.488 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
[drum beat]

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:31.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So now I want to remix it,
and I want to do that

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:35.729 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
by generating a random
beat string that I insert

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.031 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
in the middle
of the Amen Break.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.666 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
So before we insert it,

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.102 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
let's just generate a
random beat string.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.271 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
And I want this to be
a half-measure long,

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:45.973 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
so eight characters long.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:49.476 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
I am going to call
my random part "insertSection,"

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.845 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and I'll initially define it
to be an empty string—

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.315 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
just beginning quotations
and ending quotations.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.752 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And then I want a "for" loop
here for "i" in range(8),

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because I want to generate
eight characters here.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And each time I go
through that "for" loop,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.325 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I want to add another
random character

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.127 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
onto insertSection.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.462 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
To do that concatenation,

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:17.904 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
I'll say insertSection =
insertSection + randint(0,4).

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:20.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And the reason I'm doing
randint(0,4) is I want

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
that random number
that we keep on adding on

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to the beat string
to be something

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.481 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that is an index
into this drums list.

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:32.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And we have zero, one,
two, three, four elements.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:35.689 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So randint(0,4) will give me
either zero, one, two, three,

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
or four each time.

00:02:38.025 --> 00:02:40.494 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Then I'll go ahead and just put
a print statement

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:44.031 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
at the end here,
so I can see what it creates.

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:47.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I'll press run and immediately
I have an error.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:51.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Says it cannot concatenate
"str" and "int" together,

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
so that's a problem.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:56.877 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:38%
So what I need
to do is change

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.345 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
the integer
that's coming back

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
from my randint() function
into a string.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:05.519 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So I'm going to add "str" there
to convert it to a string.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And when I press run again,
it should work, and I can see

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.158 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
the random string it generated.

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:13.593 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Another thing which
I already did, but might

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.495 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
be another thing to check for
if you get an error

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is to make sure when
you're using random functions,

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
that you always import the
random library at the beginning.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.869 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So not just
"from earsketch import *,"

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:26.907 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
but also
"from random import *."

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.709 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So now I've generated this
but my music hasn't changed

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.812 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
at all because I haven't
taken these random

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:35.615 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
eight characters and put them
into the Amen break anywhere.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.718 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to combine it

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:42.522 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
with "a" so that the second time
I put an "a"—

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the first time it will be the
original "a"—

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.926 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
the second time I put
an "a" here,

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:48.128 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
I'm going to use half
of the original "a"

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
and then half
of this insertSection.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.868 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So I'll do that with
concatenation and string slices.

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:57.003 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So I'll define a new variable,
I'll call it "newA."

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.606 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And I'll start with
insertSection,

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:02.209 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
those random eight characters
that I just generated,

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.578 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and I'll concatenate on
to the end of that

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:05.745 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
the second half of "a."

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.115 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So I'll use my slice notation
to do that.

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:11.751 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And character eight of "a"
through to character 16 of "a."

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:16.857 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So now if I print out newA,
you can see that it's

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:20.861 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
taken my random string,
and it's added on

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.431 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
the second half of "a" to that.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.433 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
Now to generate
the whole string I want,

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:33.306 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I can just say newBeat equals,
instead of a + a + b + c,

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:38.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
it will be a + newA + b + c.

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:42.516 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And here, instead of amenBreak,
I can do newBeat.

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:47.921 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And we can hear what that
remixed amenBreak sounds like.

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:54.961 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
[remixed drum beat]

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.764 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
We can also compare
these side by side,

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
I can go ahead
and print out amenBreak

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.905 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
and print newBeat,
and when I run this again,

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.207 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
I can see them both
together in the console.

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:10.143 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
See, they're all identical
except these eight characters

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.213 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
here where I inserted
my randomly generated content.
