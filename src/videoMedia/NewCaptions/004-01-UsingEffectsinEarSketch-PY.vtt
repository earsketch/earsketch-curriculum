00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.740 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Hello.
Welcome to this EarSketch video.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.075 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
My name is Léa,

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:11.945 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and today I'll be talking
about the setEffect function.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.115 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
SetEffect is used
a lot in EarSketch.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.352 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Once you've populated
your tracks with sound samples

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.020 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
using fitMedia,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.825 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you can use setEffect
to add effects to your song.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:28.829 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Effects are used in the music
industry to modify sounds.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.232 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You can change the volume,
add some reverb or delay,

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.635 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
which are two different
kinds of echo.

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.004 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You can add tremolo,
a low-pass filter,

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:38.272 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
a high-pass filter,

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.941 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
and you have
countless possibilities.

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:44.711 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
With EarSketch,
there are 16 different effects.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
To use the setEffect function,

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
you need to have
four parameters.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.654 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
First the track where you want
to place your effect,

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
then the type of effect
you want to use,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.228 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
the parameter name,
and the value of the parameter.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:04.264 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
Let's see this in detail
with a script.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So I created a new script
for this example.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
As usual we import
the EarSketch library.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
We use this line
to initialize the code

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and this one to finish the code,

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:22.916 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and we use the setTempo
to set the speed of the song.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:27.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We already have a fitMedia here.
Let's listen to it.

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:35.195 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
[electronic beat]

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.098 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
Now let’s write
our setEffect line.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:42.002 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We have four parameters.
The first one is the track.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.671 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Because our sound
is on track 1 already

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.106 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
and we want to modify it,

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
we're going to apply
the effect to track 1.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.246 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
The second parameter
is the effect type.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.316 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Here we're going to take
the example of volume,

00:01:56.316 --> 00:02:00.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which will determine
if the track is loud or quiet.

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.357 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
To see a list
of all possible effects,

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:05.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you can use the EarSketch API.

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:09.496 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Go to the fourth icon
from the top in the left bar.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
This will open
your EarSketch API

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:16.103 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
it shows all the descriptions
of EarSketch functions.

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:19.573 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
If you type setEffect
in the search box,

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.775 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
you will see
the possible effect types

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:24.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
that you can use with setEffect.

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So back to our parameters.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:29.316 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
The third is
the effects parameter.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
For volume, it’s gain.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.988 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The gain as expressed
in decibels.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:40.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
It should be between minus 60
decibels and plus 12 decibels.

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:42.596 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Gain is just the name
of the parameter.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Then we need to indicate
the value we want for gain.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.536 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Let's say we want this track
to be quieter.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.539 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We're going to need
a negative value of gain.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.275 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
Let's try minus 20.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.144 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And that's all
for our parameters.

00:02:57.144 --> 00:03:00.313 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So let's listen to it once again
without the effect.

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:06.119 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
[electronic beat]

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.822 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Now let's run the code.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.995 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
You see that a new line
was added on track 1.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:17.097 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It's the volume
that we are modifying.

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:19.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Now let's hear it.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:24.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
[quieter beat]

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.809 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You can definitely hear
that the sound is quieter.

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.711 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
You can use this
to mix your song,

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.948 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which means decide which track
needs to be louder

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.751 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and which track needs
to be quieter.

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.186 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And that's all for our video.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:41.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Thank you for watching
and see you soon.
