00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:08.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Hi. Welcome to
this EarSketch video

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.011 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
about musical form
and function.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.347 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
My name is Léa,
and in this video

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.315 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I'll explain
what musical form is

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:20.053 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and how you can write
your own functions in EarSketch.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:23.957 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
As you might know,
most songs have a structure.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.527 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
This structure can be composed
of different levels.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:31.665 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Let’s say three examples
of musical levels.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.801 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
First let's talk about beats.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.838 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
Beats are regular
time intervals.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:41.942 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
They are the shortest time
divisions in your song.

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:44.711 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
For example, I will play
an EarSketch script

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.414 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and clap on the beat.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:53.487 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
[faint beat and clapping]

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.558 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
The beat duration depends
on your setTempo function

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
at the beginning of your script.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If your tempo is fast, your beat
duration is going to be short.

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But if your tempo is slower,

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
your beat duration
will be longer.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:14.374 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The second musical level we're
looking at contains measures.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:18.111 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
A measure contains
a fixed number of beats.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.914 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
In EarSketch, one measure
is equal to four beats,

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:25.218 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which is pretty common
in Western popular music.

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.754 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The timeline in the digital
audio workstation

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
indicates time both in seconds
and in measures.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
The third musical level I want
to talk to you about

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.197 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
is the section level.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Sections are broader
musical entities,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.535 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
and contrary to beats
or measures

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:44.338 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
they do not have
a fixed duration.

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
A song is composed
of several sections,

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:50.777 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
each of which represents
an idea or a feeling.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
Examples of sections are intro,
outro, verse, chorus, or solo.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.354 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
When composing music,
it's good to plan ahead

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:05.025 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and see what your song structure
will be before you start coding.

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.728 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This will help having
a good song structure

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.529 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
and code structure.

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
In this particular task,

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:15.902 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
you will be asked to create
a song with the ABA form.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.605 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
ABA means that you have
three sections,

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:23.343 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
and that the first
and last sections are the same.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.445 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
Now let's see how functions
can help

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
with the structure of your song.

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:30.484 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
You already know that functions
take some inputs

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:33.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and convert them to outputs.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.923 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So far, you've only been using
EarSketch functions

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:41.128 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
like setTempo,
fitMedia, or setEffect,

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:43.463 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
but you can also write
your own functions

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:46.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
called user defined functions.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:51.671 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
This greatly helps organize
your code for two main reasons.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
First, it will reduce
the length of your code.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
A function is like a variable

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.046 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
that contains
a set of instructions.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:01.715 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This way, when you need
to use the function,

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.217 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
you just have to call it—
which takes one line—

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
instead of having to rewrite
all the instructions.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
Second, it helps
organize your code

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.827 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and make it easier to read.

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:17.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
It's important that you give
your functions names

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:19.199 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that indicate what they do.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.569 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
For example, if you write
a function to create a verse,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.406 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you can call it “verse”
or “verse 1.”

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:31.344 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now let's see an example
of user defined function.

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:35.115 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Let's start with writing
our function definition.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.751 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
You will need to use
the keyword function

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:40.954 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and then the function name
that you chose.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
As you have seen before,

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you always add parenthesis
after function name.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
Between the parenthesis,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:51.932 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
you will write the inputs
that you want for your function.

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:55.202 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
These inputs are the ones
you will have to provide

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:58.905 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
when you call the function
later in your code.

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:02.175 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I recommend that you give
precise names to your inputs

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:06.546 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
so that it's easier
to know what they need to be.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:09.349 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
For example here,
since we will use the function

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.251 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to create a song section,

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
we will use the inputs
of the beginning

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.555 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and end of the section.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.725 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So we can call them startMeasure
and endMeasure.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.794 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
This way when we call
the function,

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:24.598 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
we can just indicate at which
measure the section should start

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.834 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
and at which measure
it will stop.

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.103 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Then we have the function
instructions,

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.938 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
which are indented.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.308 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Here our instructions
are just two fitMedia.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:38.545 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
We select sounds and tracks
for this fitMedia

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.681 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
and for the start and end time
we use the inputs,

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.718 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
starMeasure and endMeasure.

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
You are free to choose
any inputs that you like.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
You can also call them
whatever you like.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.325 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So if you want to change them
to “startTime” and “endTime,”

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
you can do that.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:56.897 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
You just need to make sure
that you use your inputs

00:04:56.897 --> 00:05:00.333 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
in the instructions
with the same spelling.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.971 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So this is it
for the function definition.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Now if we want to use
the function,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.376 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
we have to call it.

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:12.846 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Let's say we want to use this
section from measure 1 to 5.

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:17.284 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
Then I just have
to write verse(1,5).

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:21.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
One is the start time input,
and 5 is the end time input.

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:25.158 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Let's see what happens
when we run the code.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:31.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
If we want to use the function
again later in the song,

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:34.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
for example
from measure 10 to 15,

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:38.305 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
we just have to write
“verse(10,15).”

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:41.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Now let's run it

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.313 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and you see that now
we have two verse sections,

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:49.716 align:middle line:79% position:56% size:78%
from measure 1 to 5
and then from measure 10 to 15,

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.652 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and you can add more verses
if you'd like.

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:55.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so as you can see, instead
of writing four fitMedias,

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:59.159 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
one for each of the sections,

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
you just write two lines
in your function

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:06.166 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and then you call your function
as often as you want to call it.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.735 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And that's it for our video
about form and function.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.737 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
Thank you for watching.
