[digital jingle]

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Léa: Hi.
Welcome to this EarSketch video.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.114 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
My name is Léa.
And today we'll be talking about

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.985 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
one of the most used functions
in EarSketch: fitMedia.

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.822 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A function in programming
is like a function in math.

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.492 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It takes some inputs
called parameters

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.761 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and converts them
into outputs.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:32.332 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The function we're interested
in today is called fitMedia.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.435 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It takes a sound sample
from your sound library

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.672 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and places it into your song.
So let's see how it works.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.775 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
To call a function,
you have to write its name.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:46.146 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So here it's fitMedia with a
lowercase f and an uppercase M.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.715 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Then you have to read
the parameters

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.786 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
between the parenthesis
separated by commas.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So fitMedia
has four parameters.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.058 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The sound sample
that you want to use,

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.161 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the track where you want
to place your sound sample,

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.163 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
your start measure
and your end measure.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So let's review
these parameters in detail.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.806 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So I created a new script
to show you this example.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:18.078 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
As usual we initialize the code
and finish it

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.747 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and we set the tempo
which is the speed of the song.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:25.018 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Let’s write
our first fitMedia line.

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.355 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Between the parenthesis
we're going to write

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:29.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
the four parameters.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:34.461 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The first one is the sound name
so it is just like which sound

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.797 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
you want to put in your song.

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:39.399 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
For this you can go
to your sound library

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.403 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
by clicking on the top icon
in the left bar

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.439 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and listen to sounds.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.474 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Once you've found one
that you like,

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.445 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you can copy its name
by clicking on the icon

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:53.347 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to the right of the name
of the sound.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:58.652 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This will copy the name
where your cursor is.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:03.023 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So be careful not to copy it
in random places in your code

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as it will create an error
when you try to run your code.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.496 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Now the second parameter
is the track.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.767 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The track is a line in your
digital audio workstation.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:18.572 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Usually you play similar sounds
on the same track

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:23.176 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and you have one track for each
type of sound like percussion,

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.278 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
melodies, or other.

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:30.584 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
If a track is filled,
you can go to the next track

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
to add your sound.

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.821 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Here as we don't have
any sounds yet,

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.557 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we can use track number 1,
so I type 1.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.095 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The last two parameters
correspond to the start time

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.764 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and end time of your sound.

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:48.435 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Here we want to start from
the beginning so from Measure 1,

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:50.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and we end at Measure 5.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:54.441 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When you run the code,
you'll see that our sound

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:58.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
has been placed on track 1
from Measure 1 to 5.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
If you want to add
another sound,

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.184 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
just press return and
add a new fitMedia line

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.486 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
with the parameters
that you want.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.457 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And this concludes
our video about fitMedia.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:12.459 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Thank you for watching
and see you soon.
