00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.203 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Professor: So what happens
inside the computer

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:06.373 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
when you quick record
a sound with EarSketch?

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:07.808 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I want to walk through
a few basics

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.977 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of computer architecture
and then explain

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:11.879 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
exactly what’s happening.
under the hood.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.016 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So let’s talk about processes
and memory first.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.118 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Now, I want to talk first
about the CPU,

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:22.089 align:middle line:79% position:28% size:56%
which is also known as

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:22.089 align:middle line:85% position:42% size:70%
the central processing unit.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.857 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
This is the brain
of the computer.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
It’s what executes
the instructions.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
And those instructions
can be instructions

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.198 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
embedded in a program
like your web browser

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
or like Photoshop or Word.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:34.635 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Or they can be instructions

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.537 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in a script that you wrote
yourself with EarSketch.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:41.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The other really important thing
is memory.

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:44.244 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It’s also known as RAM,
random access memory.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:48.415 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This is temporary storage
for things like data,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.983 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
like audio files,

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or instructions like
the programs that the CPU—

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.589 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
the instructions
that it has to execute.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.458 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But it’s temporary storage which
means when you quit a program,

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
when you turn off your computer,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.364 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that information that’s stored
in the memory can disappear.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.134 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So we also need something
called "secondary storage,"

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:08.936 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
something like a hard disk
drive.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:11.872 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And this is more long-term
storage—

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.742 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
where you want to store
something that will last

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.712 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
for days or weeks or months
or years

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:20.147 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
after you turn a computer off

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:23.016 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and turn it back on again
as well.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.885 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Finally,
we need to think about input,

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
how signals or data are getting
into a computer—

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.924 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
things like a microphone
or a keyboard or a mouse,

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and also things like output—

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:35.028 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
how data or signals are getting
out of a computer—

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:40.367 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
things like a screen
or speakers.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So now that we’ve looked
at all that,

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
let’s see how this all relates

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:46.039 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
to using the Quick Record
feature in EarSketch

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.675 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to add a file to your EarSketch
sound browser.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.845 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The first thing you do is you
press the Record button.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And when that happens,
you have microphone input—

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:58.552 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
data coming in from the
microphone on your computer

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
going through the CPU getting
stored as sound data in memory,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
in your RAM.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.661 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Then let’s say you want to play
it.

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:09.596 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
You want to hear what it sounds
like

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.498 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
before you decide whether
you want to keep it or not.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:15.035 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So you hit the PLAY button in
that Quick Record dialogue box.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:20.874 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Well, at that point,
the sound data in your memory

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:23.276 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
goes back through the CPU
and from there

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
goes to your speakers
so that you can hear it.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.116 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Finally, what happens
if you like the sound

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:30.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
that you recorded?

00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:31.118 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
You decide you want to keep it.

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:33.453 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
You press the UPLOAD button
to save it to your account

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:34.821 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
on EarSketch.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.457 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
Well, what happens then
is a little bit more complex.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.993 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The first thing that happens
is the sound data in the memory

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:44.831 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
goes to the CPU, and it gets
converted into something

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.434 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
called a WAV file,
a standard audio file format.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But it’s still stored in memory.
It’s still temporary storage.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.141 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
To make that permanent,
that WAV file in memory

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:58.311 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
goes back through the CPU
and goes across the internet

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.581 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
all the way over to
the EarSketch server.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:04.384 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
And the EarSketch server
at that point—

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:07.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
its CPU, the CPU on the server’s
computer—

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.456 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
receives that WAV file.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:11.691 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
It stores it, first,
in the server memory,

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:16.863 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and then it commits it
to its own secondary storage—

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
its hard disk on the server.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:21.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And that is where it is stored
in the long term.

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:24.104 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
In that way, no matter
what web browser you’re using,

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:25.739 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
no matter what computer
you’re using,

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
wherever you log into EarSketch,

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.776 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
you have access to that sound

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.776 align:middle line:85% position:20% size:50%
file that you saved.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:30.844 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
You simply ask the server

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:35.182 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to pull it from its secondary
storage and send it back to you

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:37.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
over the internet.
