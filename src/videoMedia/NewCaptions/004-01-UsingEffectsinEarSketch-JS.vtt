WEBVTT00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.090[digital jingle]00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.890Lea: Hello.Welcome to this EarSketch video.00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.690My name is Lea and today00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.950I'll be talking aboutthe setEffect function.00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.130SetEffect is useda lot in EarSketch.00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.060Once you've populatedyour tracks00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.030with sound samplesusing fitMedia,00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.820you can use setEffectto add effects to your song.00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.840Effects are used in the musicindustry to modify sounds.00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.220You can change the volume,add some reverb or delay,00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.650which are two differentkinds of echo.00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.010You can add tremolo,a low-pass filter,00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.940a high-pass filter and youhave countless possibilities.00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.700With EarSketch,there are 16 different effects.00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.130To use the setEffect function00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.940you needto have four parameters.00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.660First the track where you wantto place your effect,00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.980then the type of effectyou want to use,00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.230the parameter name,and the value of the parameter.00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.280Let's see this in detailwith a script.00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.970So I created a new scriptfor this example.00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.850As usual we use this lineto initialize the code00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.340and this one to finish the code.00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.530And we use the set tempoto set the speed of the song.00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.340We already have a fitMedia here.Let's listen to it.00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.210[music clip]00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.740Now, let’s writeour setEffect line.00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.640We have four parameters.The first one is the track.00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.320Because our soundis on track 1 already00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.760and we want to modify it,00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.640we're going to applythe effect to track 1.00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.880The second parameteris the effect type.00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.950Here we're going to takethe example volume00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.460which will determineif the track is loud or quiet.00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.000To see a listof all possible effects,00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.630you can use the EarSketch API.00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.120Go to the fourth iconfrom the top in the left bar.00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.460This will openyour EarSketch API.00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.720It shows all the descriptionsof EarSketch functions.00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.200If you type setEffectin the search box,00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.390you will seethe possible effect types00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.440that you used with setEffect.So back to our parameters.00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.950The third isthe effect parameter.00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.390For volume it's gain.00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.610The gain is expressedin decibels.00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.040It should be between minus 60decibels and plus 12 decibels.00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.240Gain is just the nameof the parameter.00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.350Then we need to indicatethe value we want for gain.00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.180Let’s say we wantthis track to be quieter.00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.180We're going to needa negative value of gain.00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.890Let's try minus 20.00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.770And that's allfor our parameters.00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.130So let's listen to it once againwithout the effect.00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.811[sound clip]00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:06.040Now let's run the code.00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.610You see that a new linewas added on track 1.00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.040It's the volumethat we are modifying.00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.302Now let's hear it.00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.960[sound clip]00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.410You can definitely hearthat the sound is quieter.00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.310You can use thisto mix your song00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.590which means decidewhich track needs to be louder00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.340and which track needsto be quieter.00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.820And that's all for our video.Thank you for watching.00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.490And see you soon.
