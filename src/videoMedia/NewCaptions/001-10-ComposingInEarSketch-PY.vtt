[digital jingle]

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:07.741 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Léa: Hi.
Welcome to this EarSketch video.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.544 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
My name is Léa.
And today we'll be talking about

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:15.515 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
one of the most used functions
in EarSketch fitMedia.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.986 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
A function in programming
is like a function in math.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:21.922 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
It takes some inputs
called parameters

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:24.892 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
and converts them
into outputs.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:28.762 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The function we're interested
in today is called fitMedia.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.865 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It takes a sound sample
from your sound library

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.769 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and places it into your song.
So let's see how it works.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.205 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
To call a function,
you have to write its name.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
So here it's fitMedia with a
lowercase f and an uppercase M.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Then you have to write
the parameters

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:49.182 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
between the parenthesis
separated by commas.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.119 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So fitMedia
has four parameters.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.488 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
The sound sample
that you want to use,

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:57.591 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the track where you want
to place your sound sample,

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
your start measure
and your end measure.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.264 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So let's review
these parameters in detail.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:08.135 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So I created a new script
to show you this example.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:11.571 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
As usual we import
the EarSketch library,

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
we initialize the code
and finish it

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.211 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and we set the tempo
which is the speed of the song.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Let’s write
our first fitMedia line.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.785 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
Between the parenthesis
we're going to write

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
the four parameters.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
The first one is the sound name,
so you need to select

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
which sound you want
to put in your song.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.862 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
For this you can go
to your sound library

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:39.866 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
by clicking on the top icon
in the left bar

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.902 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
and listen to sounds.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.504 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Once you've found one
that you like,

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.941 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
you can copy its name
by clicking on the icon

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
to the right of the name
of the sound.

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:55.182 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
This will copy the name
where your cursor is.

00:01:55.182 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So be careful not to copy it
in random places in your code

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
as it will create an error
when you try to run your code.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.893 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
Now the second parameter
is the track.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:10.897 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
The track is a line in your
digital audio workstation.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:15.035 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Usually you play similar sounds
on the same track

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:19.639 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and you have one track for each
type of sound like percussion,

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:25.479 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
melodies, or other.
If a track is filled

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.049 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
you can go to the next track
to add your sound.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.284 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Here as we don't have
any sounds yet,

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:35.589 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
we can use track number 1,
so I type 1.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.525 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The last two parameters
correspond to the start time

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.361 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and end time of your sound.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.898 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Here we want to start from
the beginning so from Measure 1

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
and we end at Measure 5.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.337 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
When you run the code,
you'll see that our sound

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:55.275 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
has been placed on track 1
from Measure 1 to 5.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.779 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If you want to add
another sound, just press return

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
and add a new fitMedia line with
the parameters that you want.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.319 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And this concludes
our video about fitMedia.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.321 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Thank you for watching
and see you soon.
