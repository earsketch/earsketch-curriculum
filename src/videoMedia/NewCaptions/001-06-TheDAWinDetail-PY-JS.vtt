Professor: When you run a script
in EarSketch,

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:05.372 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
it creates a visual
representation of your music

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.641 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
in the Digital Audio
Workstation, or “DAW” view.

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:10.477 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
It also gives you controls
in that DAW view

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for playing back your music.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I want to walk through
some of this functionality

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.149 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
in more detail now.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.384 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
At the top,

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:20.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
we have the transport controls
that control playback.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.323 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
We have a rewind button to go
back to the beginning.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
The play function.

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.761 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
[techno synth melody]

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.964 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And when I click that again,
it pauses the playback.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.065 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
I have volume control here.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.433 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
I’m going to turn down
that volume,

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.603 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
so that we can hear things
a little bit better now.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.738 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
[techno synth melody]

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:38.772 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
And there’s also a mute here,

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
which completely silences
the sound.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.541 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
We’re going to turn it back on.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I can enable or disable looping.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.079 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
When it’s enabled,
when I get to the end,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.314 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
it will loop back
to the beginning.

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.883 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
There’s a metronome here
that will click on every beat

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:54.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
of the music
when it’s turned on.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:59.226 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So those are the transport
controls in a nutshell.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.395 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
Now, let me go through
the tracks view here.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.897 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
So we have four tracks
in this particular song.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.599 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
One, two, three,
and four.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.467 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And generally, each track
corresponds

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.969 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
to a different instrument

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
or a different layer
of your music.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.707 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
You decide when you call
EarSketch functions

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:18.078 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
what track they’re going
to place audio or effects onto.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.014 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So we can see the four tracks
here, the different sounds

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:23.150 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
that have been placed
onto each track

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
represented by these waveforms

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.287 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
and the names of the sounds
that are displayed as well.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:31.792 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
We can also see effects
that are placed onto tracks,

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
in this case just onto one
track, track three.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.863 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
That says volume-gain effect.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:39.099 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It’s showing up underneath track
three,

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.369 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
changing the volume of track
three.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And we can also do a few other
things

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as we’re looking through here.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We can solo individual tracks.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.543 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
So if I solo track one,

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:51.511 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
that means that only track one
will play back,

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.848 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and tracks two, three, and four
will all be muted.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
If I mute track one,

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.785 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
that means that track one
will not play back at all,

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.188 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but I’ll continue to hear
tracks two, three, and four.

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:03.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I can also bypass effects,

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:06.393 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
which is kind of like disabling
an effect temporarily.

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:08.562 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So if I bypass this volume
effect,

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:10.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I’ll no longer hear the volume
change there.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:12.499 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
It’ll just go back
at the original volume

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:13.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
as I listen to it.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
I can also hide all the effects.

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:16.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
That doesn’t disable them,

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.439 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but that gives me more space
to see all my tracks,

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.041 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
especially if I have a lot
of tracks.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:24.978 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
One final thing I want to point
out is this big red line.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.179 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
That’s called the “playhead,”

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.983 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and it shows me where I am
in the music in my timeline.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.519 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
The numbers up here show
measures of music.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.288 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Each measure is four beats
typically.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
In EarSketch it’s always
four beats.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So as I’m playing back,
I can see that playhead moving

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.896 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
to show me exactly where I am
in the music.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.399 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I can also click different
places

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:50.037 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
to jump to different spots
in the playback.

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:54.674 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
So that’s a brief tour of
the EarSketch DAW interface.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:54.708 align:middle line:85% position:10% size:0%
