Professor: Now let’s look at two
more very popular audio effects.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.975 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And before we look at them
in EarSketch,

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:10.244 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I first want to look at them
inside of Ableton Live,

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.746 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
a very popular digital audio
workstation program.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.849 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The first one I want to talk
about is volume,

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.819 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which is simply about how loud
or soft a sound is.

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:21.054 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
And when we change the volume
of the sound,

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.956 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
we adjust its gain.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.392 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We use a unit called “decibels”
to do that,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.194 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
which is sometimes abbreviated
as dB.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
And we can go
from minus 60 decibels,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.067 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which is basically silent,
up to zero decibels,

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.737 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
which is the same volume
as the original sound,

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.538 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or we can go into positive
numbers

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.741 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
up to positive 12 decibels,

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.043 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
which would be much louder
than the original sound.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.045 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
Now, usually, we want to stay

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.247 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
between negative 60
and zero decibels,

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.249 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because when we get
into the positive numbers,

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.618 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
sometimes we can cause
some distortion to the sound,

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
which we don’t usually want.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.355 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
If we were doing this
in EarSketch,

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
the name of the effect
would be "volume."

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.559 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
The effect parameter we’d be
modifying would be gain,

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.297 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and then the values could go
from minus 60 to positive 12.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:05.832 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
We can do a similar thing
in Ableton Live.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.234 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
I have a sound loaded here,

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:10.604 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
and this orange slider here
lets me change the gain

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.439 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
and the decibels of that sound.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.941 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
Right now,
you can see it’s at zero,

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:16.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
for zero dB,
zero decibels.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.111 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
And I’m going to go ahead
and play the sound,

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.415 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
lower that slider so that
it makes it softer,

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:24.184 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and then raise it back up
so it makes it louder again.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:38.765 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
[electronic musical scales]

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So as I’m changing that slider
over time,

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.606 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
we can think about doing
something like that

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
through an effect envelope
as well.

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:50.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
And we can also think about that

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
in terms of fade-in and fade-out
envelopes.

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:56.683 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So a fade-in envelope goes
from softer to louder over time.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:01.121 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
A fade-out envelope goes from
louder to softer over time.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.057 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
Another way we can think about
working with volume in a DAW

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is through the idea of mixing,
that we have a bunch

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.029 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
of different tracks
for adjusting the volume

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
on each of them so that we get
a good balance

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:12.966 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in terms of the loudness
of each track,

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.868 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
relative to each other track.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.204 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And this is a very common thing
that people do

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:19.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
in recording studios and
production environments

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:24.778 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
as they're preparing a song
to be released.

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:27.114 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The other effect I want to talk
about is a filter.

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:28.648 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
And specifically,
we’re going to talk

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
about a low-pass filter today.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.887 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
The one parameter we’re going
to modify on it

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:35.522 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
is the frequency of the filter.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
In EarSketch,
the name of the effect

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.494 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
is “filter,” and the parameter
to change its frequency

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
is filter frequency.

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:45.132 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
So let me explain for a minute
how this works,

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
again by going
into Ableton Live.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.569 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So I have a low-pass filter
loaded here.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And as I change its frequency,

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:55.342 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
I always allow the lower
frequencies of the sound—

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:59.546 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
the lower parts of the sound—
to pass through to stay.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:03.817 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
But I cut out some of the higher
kind of brighter parts

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:04.718 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:33%
of the sound.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.853 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
So as I lower this filter
frequency,

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:12.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
it will make the sound
seem darker.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.728 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And then as I raise that filter
frequency again,

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
it will make the sound seem
brighter again.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.003 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Frequency is a way of measuring
how high or low a sound,

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:24.137 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
or parts of a sound, are.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:29.976 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And the range of human hearing
for frequency goes from 20 hertz

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:35.949 align:middle line:85% position:24% size:48%
up to 20,000 hertz.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.385 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And so the frequencies that we
use in EarSketch

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
or any other digital audio
workstation program

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
go in that same range,

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.491 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
between 20 hertz
and 20,000 hertz,

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.093 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
from low to high.

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:48.829 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:41%
So you can see,
this is at 19.9,

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.098 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
so that’s about 20,000 hertz
right now,

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:52.899 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
and I’m going to lower it
way down.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.835 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
And then I’ll raise it back up
so that you can hear

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:57.437 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
what that changed filter
does to the brightness

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and darkness of the sound.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:04.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
[electronic music darkens]

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:06.646 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So now I’ve cut out
all the higher frequencies,

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.315 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
so it sounds very dark.

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:10.383 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now I’ll start bringing them
back in again.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:15.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
[electronic music brightens]

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:17.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So as we’re changing that,

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:20.293 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
again thinking of this in terms
of envelopes,

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.896 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
we can think of this in terms
of a filter sweep,

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.665 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
a very common music production
technique,

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:29.102 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
where we take the filter
frequency and we change it

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.638 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
over time, either moving it up
or moving it down

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
to change the timber
of the sound.
