Narrator: EarSketch has
a console which tells us

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:06.707 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
information about the state
of a program.

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:09.509 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
This can tell us information
about what the program is doing,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.479 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
but it can also tell us
information about errors

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.681 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
in our program
that may be very useful

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.917 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
in helping us to debug it.

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.720 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Right now, we're going to look
at using the EarSketch console

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.423 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
to debug syntax errors
in a script.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.058 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
The script I have
on the screen right now

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.828 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
has four syntax errors in it.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:29.763 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
Pause the video
for a minute and see

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.132 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
if you can find all four.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.537 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
Okay, now we're going
to use the EarSketch console

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
to try to help us
debug those errors.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.377 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
The console always appears
right under the code editor.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.978 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
And if you don't see it there
for some reason,

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.981 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
there's an icon over here,
which you can toggle

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:48.982 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
to get it to appear.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:52.252 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
I'm going to go ahead
and press the run button

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.488 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
to run our script,
and immediately we have

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.189 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
an error message show up
in the console

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.958 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
about a syntax error
that we have.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.626 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:35%
It says to us,

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.062 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
"EarSketch scripts
must consist of init(),

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.331 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
"setTempo(),
and finish() functions."

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:07.034 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
We can see init().
We can see setTempo().

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:09.736 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
We do not see finish() anywhere,
so I can go ahead

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.539 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
and add a finish() function
to the end

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.244 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
and try to run this again.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.047 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Now we can see
that line 19 in my code editor

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:21.381 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:38%
is highlighted,
and I have

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.649 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
a new error message down here.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.718 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
It says,
"ParseError: There is an error

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:28.121 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
"when reading the code,
bad input on line 19."

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:30.424 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
And line 19 is the one
that's highlighted.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.359 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
If I look at line 19
very carefully,

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.329 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
I can see I have
a sound file constant,

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.264 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
a track number,
a starting measure

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.833 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
and ending measure
as my arguments to fitMedia().

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.669 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
I am missing, however,
a comma between

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.804 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
the first two arguments.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:46.573 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
So there was no comma
after the sound file constant.

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.709 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
I added that comma.
I'll let it run again.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.846 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
And what do you know,
we still have a parse error

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.849 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
on line 19,
the exact same error message

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:35%
we had before.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.418 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
Well maybe there's
another error

00:01:58.418 --> 00:01:59.686 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
on this line as well.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.122 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
If you look through carefully,
we can see that fitMedia(),

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.125 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
the EarSketch function,
has a capital "M"

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.393 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
not a lowercase "m."

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:08.095 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
So I need to change
that lowercase "m"

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:08.895 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
to an uppercase "M."

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.698 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
A very common source
of syntax errors

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:14.201 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
is using incorrect spelling
or capitalization

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.137 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
on a function name
or a variable name.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.774 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
Now I'll hit run again,
and I still have a parse error

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:21.575 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:28%
on line 19.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
At this point,
I'm going to look through

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
line 19 very carefully,
but it looks perfect to me.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.983 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
And this is a common thing
that happens with debugging

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.585 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
is that the parse error
actually happens

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:34.621 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
the line after where
the error is happening.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:38.258 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
And so you have to go back
up through your script

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.659 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
to the previous line
and see if there

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.694 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
might be an error there.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:44.031 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
So go to the previous line—
line 18 is just a comment

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:47.701 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
and line 17 is just empty space—
so you actually have

00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.835 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
to go back to line 16.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.205 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
And here we see an error
as we have setTempo(120,

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:55.776 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
there's no parenthesis
at the end of the line there

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:57.911 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
closing out
this function argument.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.513 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
So I add the parenthesis.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:03.183 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
I hit run, and I've fixed
all four of the syntax errors.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.951 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
I finally get the music
in my DAW,

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:05.919 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
and I can listen to it.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:14.294 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
