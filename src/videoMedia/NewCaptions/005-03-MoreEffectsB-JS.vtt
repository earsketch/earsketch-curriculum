00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:03.403 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
Instructor: Let's look
at how to use volume

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.539 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
and filter effects
and EarSketch script

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:08.775 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:56%
with setEffect
and effects envelopes.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.110 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
We start our script
in the usual way

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.179 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
with the init() function,
setting our tempo

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.848 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
to 120 beats per minute,
and then we have

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.017 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
a fitMedia() function here—
we're just placing a clip

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.052 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
from the EarSketch
sound library on track 1

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.722 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
starting at the beginning
of measure 1,

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.156 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
ending at measure 9.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.726 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This gives us some sounds
that we can work with,

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:27.361 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that we can add effects to.

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.297 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
So let's hear what that sound
sounds like with no effects.

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:40.107 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[electronic notes
ascending and descending]

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:41.675 align:middle line:85% position:49% size:13%
Okay.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
Now before we actually start
with the setEffect() calls,

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I'm defining
some variables here—

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:49.049 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
pointA, pointB, pointC,
D, E, and F—

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.753 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
to represent particular measure
locations on my timeline

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:55.856 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
where I want to start
or end effects envelopes.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.258 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
This helps a lot in terms
of keeping track of where

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.427 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
these points are—
enabling me to change them

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
later if I need to tweak them.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.632 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
And also, helping me
reuse these more than once

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.502 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
if I need to use them in more
than one effects envelope.

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:10.704 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So pointA is
the beginning of measure 1;

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:12.506 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
pointB is the beginning
of measure 4;

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:15.442 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:61%
pointC is 6.5,
which is halfway between

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.411 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the start of measure 6
and the start of measure 7;

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.113 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
pointD, measure 7;
pointE halfway between

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.916 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
the start of measure 8
and the start of measure 9;

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.452 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
and pointF,
the start of measure 9.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.188 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
So now let's go ahead
and enable this first

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.257 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
setEffect() call here
on track 1, which is

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.892 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
the only track I have
any sound on.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:35.963 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:63%
The effect name is FILTER
and the effect parameter

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:37.564 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:41%
I'm manipulating
is the frequency

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.967 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
of that filter—FILTER_FREQ.

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.703 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
Now this envelope is going
to go from pointA—

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:45.305 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
that's measure 1—
to pointB, measure 4.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.041 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
And it's going to start
at 20 hertz, which is

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.478 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
the lowest possible value
I can give to this filter,

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.247 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
so it's going to be
extremely dark.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.551 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
And then, it's going to end
at 10,000 hertz.

00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.653 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
Remember we can vary
this filter frequency

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:01.688 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
from 20 up to 20,000
so it's not all the way

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.057 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
to the maximum,
but it's up quite a bit.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.326 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
So what we'll hear
is this filter sweep going from

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.362 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
and extremely dark sound
that's gradually getting

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:11.131 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
brighter and brighter
from measure 1 to measure 4.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.601 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I can run this, we can see
the effect envelope here

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.805 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
ramping up from 20 hertz
all the way up to 10,000 hertz

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:24.211 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
and then we can hear
that filter sweep as well.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:29.049 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
[electronic notes
ascending and descending]

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.153 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
So now let's use some additional
setEffect() calls with

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.623 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
the volume effect to create
some fade-ins and fade-outs.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:39.593 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
So let's look at this first
setEffect() call here. 

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:41.962 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
Again, on track 1,
the effect is VOLUME,

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:44.264 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the parameter is GAIN—
that's how much I'm increasing

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
or decreasing the volume by.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:49.403 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
And we're starting
at -10 decibels,

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.838 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
going up to 0 decibels—

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.941 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
and remember 0 is the
original volume of the sound—

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:56.977 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
doing that from pointB,
measure 4,

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:00.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
up to pointC, measure 6.5.

00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
And so if we run this,
we see another effects lane

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.821 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
showing up here for VOLUME-GAIN
and we can see from measure 4

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:10.791 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
up to half way between 6 and 7,

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.194 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
a slight increase there
from -10 up to 0.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:21.001 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
Now, if I uncomment
the next line here we can see

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:25.939 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
that we're starting a fade-out—
going from 0 back down to -10

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.744 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
starting at pointD, measure 7,
pointE, 8.5.

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:35.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
And if I run, you can see
that fadeout here from 7 to 8.5.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:38.285 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
But that doesn't get me
down silence and it doesn't

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:41.488 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
get me all the way to measure 9,
so I'm going to add one more

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:46.793 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
setEffect() call here that goes
from pointE at 8.5 to pointF,

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:51.531 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
measure 9, going from -10
all the way to -60 which is

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.668 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
the lowest decibels I can give
to a VOLUME-GAIN

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
in EarSketch which
represents basically silence.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
So if I run with that
last envelope on that

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.342 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
last part of the fade-out
you can see it comes down

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
very quickly and sharply there

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:68%
to bring me down
to silence at the very end.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.415 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
So now we can hear
the whole thing with

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.984 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
the fade-ins and the fade-outs
and the filter sweep.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:25.732 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:63%
