WEBVTT00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.875[digital jingle]00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:06.150Brandon: Hey.00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.090My name is Brandon and I'ma member of the EarSketch team.00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.620In this video,I'm going to give you00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.000a quick tourof the EarSketch user interface00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.860including all the componentsof the workspace.00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.950Let's start from square one.00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.810If you don't haveEarSketch open yet,00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.250it can be accessed atEarSketch.gatech.edu/EarSketch2.00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.010There's nothing wrongwith Googling the Web site00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.370or creating a bookmark either.00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.860If you don't havean EarSketch account00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.020you can register a new accountusing the button00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.435in the top right corner.00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.850I already have an account00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.190so I'm going to entermy credentials00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.890in the fields to the left.00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.190And then hitthis little arrow to log in.00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.930In the same areayou can see two other icons.00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.190This one here controlsthe text size of the curriculum00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.580and the code editor00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.210and the other displayssome useful keyboard shortcuts.00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.700Next, bring your attentionto the far left of the window00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.250where you can seea series of large icons.00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.380Clicking these will openand close the various modules00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.590of the EarSketch workspace.00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.580Let's start at the topwith the sound browser.00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.850Like the name implies,00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.810in this panel you canlook through over 4000 loops00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.070that are includedwith EarsSketch00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.640for you to useinside of your music.00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.550It's also possibleto add your own sounds00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.060by clicking the textat the top of the browser,00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940Add Your Own Sound.00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.550This is covered in detailin Chapter 11.00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.790There are a number of approaches00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.210to finding sounds to usewithin your script.00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.440If you generally knowwhat you're looking for already,00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.760you can type within the searchfield here and hit Enter.00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.580I typically use the Filter menuto find new sounds though.00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.780First selecting the genreI'm interested in.00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.010And then maybethe specific instrument00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.920from the other drop-down menu.00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.240You'll notice that each soundhas two icons00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.630to the right of the name.00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.070The first plays the clipso we can preview it.00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:04.360[kalimba playing]00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.800The star icon in the middlelets you favorite a clip00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.300so you can return to iteasily in the future.00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.080Use this for soundsyou use often.00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.620It turns out thatthis top sound here00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.760is actually my favoriteand all of EarSketch,00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.140so I'm going to hit the icon.00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.280If I turn on Show Only Favoriteswith this button here,00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.190you can see this clip alongwith any other sounds00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.570I favorited in the past.00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.990And finally, the buttonon the right here00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.740lets you paste the nameof the sound clip00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.940into the code you're writing00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.920so you don't have to type outthese long names manually.00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.490Also, be aware thatif you mouse over00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.080the name of a soundsome additional information00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.810will display includingthe original tempo of the clip.00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.120OK let's move onto the Scripts browser—00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.350the next large icon on the left.00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.500Each time you write codein EarSketch your scripts00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.330are automatically saved to thecloud provided you're logged in.00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420You can see all these scriptshere in the scripts browser00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.710which allows you to interactwith your saved scripts00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.330in different ways.00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.820You'll probably use this browserthe most to simply open up00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.030a specific script like this one.00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.240You can see it immediately opens00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.070as a new tabwithin the code editor00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.090here in the centerof the EarSketch interface.00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.170Just like with sounds you cansearch and filter your scripts,00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.850but I'd liketo specifically point out00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.190some of the advanced features00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.330that can be accessedthrough the pull down menu00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.060to the rightof each script name.00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.940So skipping oversome of the basic items00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.660I can download an audio fileof the music my script creates,00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.930share a script as SoundCloud,00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.080or get a link that I can shareor embed anywhere00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.160and you can even viewa history of your code00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.460looking back throughthe changes you've made.00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.180This option also lets yourevert back00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.040to an older versionof your script00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.890if you don't likethe changes you've made.00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.500You also have the optionto show scripts00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.350that you've deleted in the past.00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.710Maybe you deleteda script by accident.00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.930Fortunately, a deleted scriptcan be retrieved00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.610by clicking the curved arrowto the right of the name.00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.200Moving on to the next icon,00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.770this is the SharedScripts browser.00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.210Sadly, I've only had one scriptshared with me so far00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.720but this is whereyou can see scripts00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.680that someonehas shared with you.00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.020To learn how to share scriptsand how to interact with them00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.250check out the informationin Chapter 21, Section 4.00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.270The last folder type iconon the left here00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.820is the EarSketch API browser.00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.350This browser shows and explainsthe special functions00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.740that our team has addedto the Python and JavaScript00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.680programming languagesto let you make music.00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.370Here you can viewfunction names,00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.740the parameters each functiontakes,00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.280explanations of each function,00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.340and examples of how to useeach function.00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.320Just like sounds,you can use this button00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.920to paste a function nameinto your script.00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.260The next icon down the line hereis a toggle button00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.960that turns the workstationon and off,00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.620more commonly knownas the digital00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.310audio workstation, or DAW.00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.230We cover this in detail laterin Chapter 1.00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.290The remaining two iconsare also toggles,00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.620one for the consoleand one for the curriculum,00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.530which we'll get to in a bit.00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.010Now I'm going to leavethe left side bar00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.240and direct your attention00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.560to the middleof the EarSketch workspace.00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.590This is the Code Editor wherewe actually write and edit code.00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.540You can see I havea script open from earlier,00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.040so if I hit run, you'll seethe music in the DAW00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.740and we can play it.00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:15.911[sound clip]00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:17.030You could also see a message00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.970stating that our scriptran successfully00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.070in the top message bar.00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.140The code editoralso has a few options00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.470you can access throughthe gear drop down menu00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.220like changing the backgroundcolor from black to white.00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.250Directly below the code editoris the council.00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.740We cover different featuresof the console00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.770throughout the curriculum,but in short, it's responsible00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.080for displaying informationto the programmer.00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.370The last thing I want to showyou is the curriculum00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.980which is all the wayto the right of your window.00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.460The curriculum is the best wayto learn about EarSketch00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.130including writing codeand making music.00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.920The curriculum has a couplereally cool features.00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.000First like other areasof EarSketch00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.070it gives the ability to search.00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.470Just type what you're lookingfor into the search bar00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.540and the curriculum will displaya list of sections00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.750that include your search item.00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.240If I look farther downon the page00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.050or click one of these sections,you can see that our search term00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.970is highlightedthroughout the text.00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.200Above the search bar,you can also find icons00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.376for copying the curriculum URL,00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.860displaying the slidesused in EarSketch classes,00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.990expand the curriculumto full size,00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.960and quickly accessthe table of contents.00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.540You may have also noticedthat there are00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.450a number of code examplesthroughout the curriculum.00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.750By hitting the blue paste iconon the top-right of the script,00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.350you can paste itinto your code editor00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.300so you can run it,hear what it sounds like,00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.780and even edit it yourself.00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.100Finally, there are a number ofvideos throughout the curriculum00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.430like the oneyou're watching right now.00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.150They show up very smallmost of the time00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.690so if you're watchingin EarSketch00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.400make sure to hitthe little expand icon.00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.175That's it for this video.Thanks for watching.00:06:52.953 --> 00:06:58.405[kalimba playing]
