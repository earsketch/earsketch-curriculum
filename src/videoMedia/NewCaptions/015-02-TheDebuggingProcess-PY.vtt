Instructor: Let's use
these debugging techniques

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.439 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:53%
to find and fix a bug
in this script.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.609 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:48%
This script defines
a variable, "beat,"

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.577 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to be a beatString()
and a variable "sound"

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.212 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
to be a sound constant
from the EarSketch

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
sound library.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.916 align:middle line:79% position:47% size:58%
It then has a for loop,
which calls makeBeat()

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:21.355 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:73%
eight times to put the rhythm
onto track 1 of the DAW

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.291 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
eight times in a row.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.159 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
When I hit
the run button, though,

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.563 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
I get an error on line 23—
my makeBeat() function call.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:31.431 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
And the error message
in the console is

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.133 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
a little bit hard to understand.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.736 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
It says, "ValueError:
A provided argument

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:38.505 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
"is not within the set or range
of acceptable values

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.406 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:43%
"for a function."

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.975 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
So since I don't know exactly
what that means

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.744 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
or how to fix it,
I'm going to go ahead

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:47.147 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
and print out the values
of all the arguments

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
to the function
using print function in Python.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.392 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
So I'll say "print sound,
print measure, and print beat."

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
So every time we go
through this for loop now,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.529 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
it will tell me
what all the values

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.698 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
of the function arguments are
that I'm using

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:05.832 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
to call makeBeat().

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.768 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
So now I can press run again
and I can see

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:09.236 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
those values on the console.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.472 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
I can see the value of "sound"—
first time I go

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:15.208 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
through this for loop
is my sound constant

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.044 align:middle line:10% position:48% size:48%
so that seems okay.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:21.648 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
And then I can see "measure"
is 0 and then I can see "beat"

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.716 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
is the beatString().

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.985 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
So the problem here
seems to be with "measure"

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.888 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
because "measure"
can't be 0 in EarSketch.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.657 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
The first measure of the song
is always measure 1.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.125 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
So that seems to be the issue.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.195 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
So let me go ahead
and remove the print

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:39.433 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:61%
of the beatString()
and remove "print sound"

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.934 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
so I can focus
just on the measure.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.336 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:45%
And then I'm going
to go ahead

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:44.972 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
and comment out
the makeBeat() function call.

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:48.342 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
So I can see how this is working
without makeBeat() in there,

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.777 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
see if the script will run
and what the values

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:51.778 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
of "measure" come out to be.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.548 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:50%
So I press run there
and now I can see,

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.717 align:middle line:10% position:45% size:73%
as I go through the for loop,
it's printing the value

00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:59.286 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
of "measure" each time
I go through the for loop.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:02.789 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:81%
And I can see
it's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.125 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
Well that's not right
because I want it to

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.663 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:75%
So to fix that,
I need to change the arguments

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:12.632 align:middle line:10% position:46% size:68%
to this range function here
to have two arguments,

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
my starting point, 1,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.403 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:65%
and then
the stopping condition, 9.

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.506 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
And so if I press run we'll see
what will actually happen.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.809 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:58%
Now we get
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.711 align:middle line:10% position:44% size:78%
which is exactly what I wanted.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.381 align:middle line:10% position:47% size:53%
So now I can go ahead
and uncomment

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.183 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
the makeBeat() function call
and see if it works now

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:33.653 align:middle line:10% position:50% size:70%
that I'm sending it
the correct measure numbers.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.322 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
And now I can listen
to the rhythm

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:36.656 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
repeated eight times.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:52.973 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:56%
