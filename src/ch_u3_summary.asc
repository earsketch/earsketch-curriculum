== Unit 3 Summary
:nofooter:

Let's review the last unit.

<<ch_17#,Chapter 17:>>

* Console input entrusts certain decisions about musical output to the user, making a script more interactive. <<ch_17#consoleinput,17.1>>
* Boolean logic lets the computer make decisions based on a condition. Boolean values can only be true or false. They are generated using comparison operators. Boolean operators, another category of operators, let us check multiple conditions. <<ch_17#booleans,17.2>>
* The basic conditional statement is the _if_ statement. It only executes when its condition is true. _else_ statements are used to execute an alternative code block in the event that an _if_ statement evaluates to false. <<ch_17#conditionalstatements,17.3>>

<<ch_18#,Chapter 18>> and <<ch_19#, Chapter 19:>>

* Data structures store a collection of values in a single entity. Indices are used to refer to individual elements of the structure. <<ch_18#datastructurebasics,18.1>>
* A for-loop provides a simple way to iterate through an entire structure. <<ch_18#iteratingthroughadatastructure,18.2>>
* `makeBeat()` can be used with data structures to create rhythms out of multiple sound clips. <<ch_18#usingdatastructureswithmakebeat,18.3>>
* Data structures can be concatenated and sliced. <<ch_19#procedure,19.1>>

<<ch_20#,Chapter 20:>>

* Randomness allows the computer to control some aspects of music making. The majority of random processes in EarSketch rely on the generation of random numbers, a number that is impossible to predict. <<ch_20#randomnumbers,20.1>>
* Introducing randomness into a program creates unique musical output and variations each time the code is run.

<<ch_21#,Chapter 21:>>

* Peer feedback provides the opportunity to learn from others. It is most useful when provided or received constructively. <<ch_21#peerfeedback,21.1>>
* We learned about the critical response process and a series of tips for providing and receiving feedback. <<ch_21#criticalresponseprocess,21.2>>
* Programming efficiency and output benefit from collaboration and pair programming. We learned strategies for collaborating effectively.  <<ch_21#collaboration,21.3>>
* We covered the process of sharing a script in EarSketch. <<ch_21#sharinganearsketchscript,21.4>>

Check out the optional lessons for even more interesting ways to make music in EarSketch.
