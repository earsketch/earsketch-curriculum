=== The Challenge

*Weekly Challenge #6: Remix with Gratitude -*

*Say Thank-You Through Code*

This week we are challenging you to say Thank You through Code. As we navigate our time at home during this pandemic, you may want to show your gratitude for our essential workers, healthcare workers, teachers, or a friends (who may keep you entertained on zoom). You may be thankful for your health, your family, or maybe just chocolate…whatever it is, we want you to share. Use your `fitMedia()`, `setEffect()`, and `makeBeat()` functions and your for-loops to create a song that shows your gratitude. This week’s challenge will be a good review of everything we have learned over the last five weeks and you will learn how to use comments to explain the purpose of your song.

- The remix must be a minimum of 20 seconds but less than 2 minutes

- It must include at least one stem from Common or Ciara

- It must include comments to explain the purpose of your song

- You should use other functions such as `fitMedia()`, `setEffect()` or `makeBeat()` or for-loops to compose your song.
