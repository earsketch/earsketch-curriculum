== Effects and Envelopes
:nofooter:

Adding effects with `setEffect()` can completely transform a piece of music. This chapter introduces additional effects and time-varying effects.

[[envelopes]]
=== Envelopes
It is not always practical to add an effect to an entire track. *Envelopes* allow us to add effects to smaller portions of a track and define how an effect's parameters change over time. They can be used with any effect parameter.

Envelopes are described using a series of value-time pairs. Each pair contains an effect parameter value and a point in time to set the value. For example, (-60, 1, -10, 5) means a point is placed at measure 1 at value -60, and another at measure 5 with value -10. The envelope creates a line between these points, a smooth transition called a *ramp*. The figure below shows a `VOLUME` ramp envelope in EarSketch using the `GAIN` effect parameter.

=== Envelopes with setEffect

The `setEffect()` function takes a variable number of arguments. Its full set of arguments is listed below.

. trackNumber
. effectName
. effectParameter
. effectStartValue
. effectStartLocation
. effectEndValue
. effectEndLocation

The last five parameters are *optional parameters*; if left unspecified, they are set to the default value. In the previous chapter we used `setEffect()` 's first four parameters (the remaining set to the default value) to apply an effect to an entire track. We will need to use all of `setEffect()` 's parameters to create envelopes. Each `setEffect()` call takes two value-time pairs: {effectStartValue, effectStartLocation}; {effectEndValue, effectEndLocation}. The following example creates a volume ramp by calling `setEffect()` with all seven arguments.

*Volume* is related to loudness, in which sounds are ordered on a scale from quiet to loud. The gradual increase or decrease in volume, like in the previous example, is called a *fade*. Fades can be used to start and end a piece, or even to transition between tracks, as detailed in <<musical-repetition#advancedtransitiontechniques,Chapter 14>>. Fades are achieved by creating a `VOLUME` envelope with the `GAIN` parameter. The `VOLUME` effect can also be used to effectively mix a composition. *Mixing* is the process of balancing multiple audio tracks to sound cohesive when played together.

*Filtering* is the process of removing certain components of a sound. EarSketch's `FILTER` effect is a low-pass filter, meaning it lets low frequency sounds "pass through" while dropping the volume of higher frequencies above a certain frequency. This frequency, the *cutoff frequency*, is determined by `FILTER` 's `FILTER_FREQ` parameter. Increasing this parameter over time creates a filter sweep, letting more frequencies "pass through" the filter. Low-pass filtering typically leads to a muffled or darker sound.

In the next example, we use `VOLUME` and `FILTER` with a series of time points to create more complex envelopes. This requires making several consecutive `setEffect()` calls. Note that both effects are stacked on a single track.

*Reverb* is an effect in which a sound persists after it is initially played. Similar to delay, reverb creates a slowly decaying ambiance. It typically gives a sound a sense of space. The `REVERB` effect has parameters to control the decay time and amount of the effect present, `REVERB_DECAY` and `MIX`, respectively.

Listen to the clips below to hear the result of adding reverb to a track:

=== Chapter 5 Summary
* *Envelopes* define how an effect parameter changes over time. They are described with value-time pairs, like _(value, time, value, time)_.
* All of `setEffect()` 's parameters need to be used to create envelopes. The 7-parameter `setEffect()` arguments are:
** *trackNumber:* The track the effect is added to.
** *effectName:* The specific effect being used.
** *effectParameter:* The setting used for the effect.
** *effectStartValue:* The starting value of the parameter.
** *effectStartLocation:* The measure at which the starting value is set.
** *effectEndValue:* The ending value of a parameter.
** *effectEndLocation:* The measure at which the ending value is set.
* *Volume* is related to loudness, in which sounds are ordered on a scale from quiet to loud.
* A *filter* removes certain frequency components of a sound.
* *Reverb* creates a slowly decaying ambiance, in which the sound persists after it is initially played.
* A complete list of EarSketch effects and their parameters can be found in <<every-effect-explained-in-detail#,effects>>, along with descriptions for each.
