== String Operations
:nofooter:

Previously, the string data type was used to make beat strings for `makeBeat()`. Methods for modifying strings, string operations, are introduced in this chapter. Before we investigate these methods, let's look at a new way to make use of use custom functions.

[[returnstatements]]
=== Return Statements

Previously when we have called a function, we provide it some input (arguments) and then it simply executes its code block. What if we wanted to use a value generated inside a function later on, maybe outside the function?

In addition to taking some sort of input, functions can output a value. In programming, we call this returning a value. The statement that tells a function to return a value is called the *return statement*. Let's look at a simple code example to see how return statements work.

# Simple Return Statements: Returning the result of a mathematical expression

# Setup
from earsketch import *
setTempo(120)

# Body
def addNumbers(numb1, numb2):
    answer = numb1 + numb2
    return answer

result = addNumbers(2, 2)
# Print result to the console
print(result)

setTempo(120);

// Body
function addNumbers(numb1, numb2) {
    var answer = numb1 + numb2;
    return answer;
}

var result = addNumbers(2, 2);
// Print result to the console
println(result);
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
In the example above, the `addNumbers()` custom function takes two arguments, adds them together, and assigns the sum to the variable `answer`. The function returns this variable on line 20. The return statement in this example is saying, "Give the value in `answer` back to whatever called me." Instead of calling `addNumbers()` on its own, we assign it to the variable `result` on line 22. This lets us use the value that the function returns.

Instead of calling `addNumbers()` on its own, we assign it to the variable `result` on line 22. This lets us use the value that the function returns.

To see what our function has returned, we use the `print` statement, which prints `result` to the console. For a detailed description of printing check out <<debugging-logic#printingtotheconsole,Printing to the Console>>.

The `createBeat()` custom function takes some inputs, performs its operations, and then returns the value assigned to `endMeasure`. In order to use the value, it must be assigned to a variable outside the function, like in line 33. The returned value is passed into the second function call as an argument. In this way, the beats created by each function call are chained together in time. With the addition of the return statement, the complete control flow for a function looks like this:

Without a return statement a function does not return or output any value. This is OK; functions do not need to have a return statement. Also be aware that the return statement signals the function to stop. If you have any statements after the return keyword, they will be ignored. We will see another example of how a return statement can be used later in this chapter.

[[stringconcatenation]]
=== String Concatenation

[role="curriculum-python"]
*Concatenation* is a means to link strings together. In doing so, a new string is formed. For example, concatenating the strings `"hello"` and `"world"` yields `"helloworld"`. Strings are concatenated with the `+` symbol, like in the following example. To view the new string we use the `print` statement to print the string to the console.

String concatenation can be used to form longer, more complex rhythms. In the example below, we define a set of shorter rhythms with beat strings. Then, these strings are concatenated together in different orders to form a series of final beat strings. The resulting rhythm can be easily modified by changing the concatenation order, or changing the individual beat strings at the top of the script.

[[substrings]]
=== Substrings
A *substring* is partial string, also known as a slice, that occurs inside of a larger string. This allows a beat to be sliced up, a very popular technique in electronic music and remixing.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Python's *slice notation* is used to make a substring. Its syntax is `myString[startIndex: endIndex]`. Assigning this expression to a variable stores the substring in that variable. Like we have seen before, `startIndex` and `endIndex` are inclusive and exclusive, respectively. The substring includes the character at `startIndex` but not the character at `endIndex`.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
JavaScript's *substring()* function is used to make a substring. Its syntax is `oldString.substring(startIndex, endIndex)`. Assigning the return value of this function to a variable stores the substring in that variable. Like we have seen before, `startIndex` and `endIndex` are inclusive and exclusive, respectively. The substring includes the character at `startIndex` but not the character at `endIndex`.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
.DOT NOTATION
****
`oldString.substring` is called *dot-notation*. JavaScript strings can be modified with a helper function, called a *method*. Methods are called by specifying the string (`oldString`) followed by a dot (`.`), and ending with the method. Methods cannot be called without dot-notation.
****

[role="curriculum-python"]
.INDICES
****
An *index* represents the position of a particular character in a string. In Python, string indices start at 0. Therefore, the last index of a string is its total length minus one. Python's `len()` function can be used to get the length of a string, like `len(string)`. This value can be stored in a variable to use later, or printed to the console. The indices of the string `"EarSketch"` are shown in the table below.

.INDICES

An *index* represents the position of a particular character in a string. In JavaScript, string indices start at 0. Therefore, the last index of a string is its total length minus one. JavaScript's `length` property can be used to get the length of a string, like `string.length`. Like the `substring` method, `length` uses dot-notation. However, unlike a method, a property in JavaScript should not be called using parentheses. The length value can be stored in a variable to use later, or printed to the console. The indices of the string `"EarSketch"` are shown in the table below.

AW: Old paragraphs commented out:
[role="curriculum-python"]
Let's slice up a beat and reconstruct it using string operations. The example below starts by defining a function to expand a beat. It makes a longer beat by taking the first character of a beat string and concatenating it to the first two characters, then to the first three characters, and so on. For example, the beat string "0+0-" would become "0" + "0+" + "0+0" + "0+0-" which is "00+0+00+0-". Within the function, an empty string, `newBeat`, is defined. Inside the for-loop, slice notation is used and the resulting substring is concatenated to `newBeat` repeatedly.

We can use string operations to take a simple piece of code and expand it into a complex element of our composition. Let's start with a very simple beat string: `"0+0-"`. Instead of simply repeating the string to lengthen it, we can use concatenation to take each individual piece of the beat and add it on to the larger string in stages. Let's step through that process: Breaking apart our original beat, we have the elements `0`, `+`, `0`, and `-`. We can design a function to first concatenate `"0"`, then `"0+"`, then `"0+0"`, then `"0+0-"` all in a row, resulting in the *newBeat* string `"00+0+00+0-"`. Take a look at the code below; our *expander()* custom function uses slice notation to concatenate a much longer beat string into *newBeat*.
