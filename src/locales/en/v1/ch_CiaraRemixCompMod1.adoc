[[TimeToRemix]]
=== Time to REMIX

The challenge is out... it’s time to start making music. Your song for this competition will be a remix including one or more clips from *Ciara’s hit song "Set"* off her latest album: _Beauty Marks_.


video::iUPYYqkrMX0[youtube]


If you want to read more about Ciara – you can view her biography on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara[Wikipedia].

Ciara is excited to see how you can creatively remix her music. Many of you may have heard the term remix as you listen to today’s top hits on the radio. Remixing a piece of music gives it a new life—it changes its style, mood, tempo, and harmony. 

For this competition, you will use one or more sound clips from Ciara to create a new piece of music inspired by her work.  ou may remix her clips with sound files by other artists provided by (and possibly some that you may upload on your own). You may also layer your own vocals or instrumentals into the remix to showcase your musical talent.

_How cool would it be to mix your own music with Ciara’s?_

So how do you get started? Let’s take a look at a short song in EarSketch that remixes some of Ciara’s stems. Follow the directions below to begin your coding experience.

_So what do you think? Did you recognize some of Ciara’s stems in the song? What else did you hear? Are you inspired? Can you do better? Is it hard to believe that this short song was entirely composed through code?_

It may look complicated, but let’s break it down step by step.






[[BeginToCode]]
=== Beginning to Code

The text that you pasted into your code editor to play the remix was written in the Python coding language. 

Python is a programming language that is used for web development, gaming, education, and graphics. If you would prefer to code in JavaScript, you also have that option in EarSketch. You can toggle the coding language in the curriculum panel. See below for pictures of the change between Python and JavaScript.

You can also choose your coding language when creating a script.


image::../media/CiaraRemixComp/img5.png[]


EarSketch is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) with extra tools. A DAW is specialized computer software for recording, editing, and playing digital audio files.

Have you worked with a DAW before? If you have used GarageBand, Pro Tools, Logic Pro or Reaper, then you have used a DAW. EarSketch has a collection of tools to help you make music. This collection of tools is called an Application Programming Interface, or API.

[[CreateBasicScript]]
=== Creating a Basic Script

The text that you pasted into your code editor is called a script. Your script is code that the computer understands as a set of directions. Just as you would follow a basic recipe to bake a
cake, the computer will follow a recipe to play your music.

Let’s take a closer look at this script.

The script is numbered; we are going to start by looking at our first five lines.



[source,python]
----
# A Remix of Ciara "Set"

from earsketch import *
----



You may notice immediately that in front of the text in these lines are the # sign. These lines are not trending hashtags on twitter, but comments. The computer does not execute code that is preceded by the #.

In this code, there are comments about the purpose of the code, the source of some of the music in the code, and the author of the code. When you create a script for the competition, you will want to include comments to inform the judges of your thinking behind the code.

Always put the # sign in front of your comments. You can also use the # sign to see how your script functions with or without some lines.


.Student Activity: Using the # sign
****
. Click play at the top of the EarSketch DAW to listen to your script again.

. Go to line 19 in your script editor and place a `#` in front of `fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8,1,1,9)`

. Run your script again.

. What happens? What is different about your song?

. Remove the `#` sign from line 19

. Scroll down to lines 50-59. Remove `#` signs from some of the lines.

. Run your script again.

. What happens now? Do you like any of the new sounds? _You can add and remove these sounds with the `#` sign._

Questions for discussion:

What are some other reasons you might include comments in your script?

Look at the script—do you see other areas where comments have been added? What do they
tell you about the script?

****






[[BuildingBlocksNumbers]]
=== Numbers

In the basic script provided, you will notice code such as `setTempo()` and `fitMedia()`. These are called functions. Functions tell the computer what to do based on information, known as arguments. The parentheses after a function provide space for arguments.

As you begin coding in EarSketch, we will focus on arguments including numbers, variables, and constants. `setTempo()` is an example of a function with a number.


[source,python]
----
setTempo(120)
----


In your script, you will see the number `120` in parentheses after the setTempo function. This tells the computer the number of beats per minute (the speed or pace of the song). One way to remix music is change the tempo, like taking a slower song and speeding it up for dancing.

Every EarSketch script opens with a baseline tempo of 120 beats per minute—a fast walk or marching speed.


.Student Activity: Change the tempo
****
1. It’s time to listen to your song again. Click play at the top of the EarSketch DAW.

2. Now change the tempo by changing the number in parentheses after `setTempo()`.
You can increase the tempo to `150` or decrease it `90`.

3. Click run again and then the green play button. How did changing the tempo affect the mood of the music?

4. Here are some examples of average tempos of different music genres. Try different tempos with your current script.

* Hip Hop: 85-95 bpm
* Pop: 110-118 bpm
* Techno: 120-136 bpm
* Electro: 120-136 bpm
* House: 115-128 bpm
* Dubstep and Trap: 140-144 bpm

[[BuildingBlocks]]
=== fitMedia

Time to keep dancing forward. line 19 contains the function `fitMedia()` that allows you to play
sound clips. Sound clips are organized in rows called tracks on a timeline that shows time in
both seconds and measures. Using `fitMedia()` on its own won’t automatically play the music.
You will need to provide the arguments in order for the computer to know what to do.
`fitMedia()` function takes in four input arguments:

* sound clip name
* track number
* start measure
* end measure

Look at line 19 of our code. `fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8,1,1,8)`

This means that the sound clip `RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8`. will be played on track 1,
starting at measure 1 and ending at measure 8.

If you click play to run your script, you will
see the sound clip plays for seven measures on track 1 (because it stops at the beginning of
measure 8).


.Student Activity: Experimenting with start and end times
****
. Look at line 20: `fitMedia(groove,2,1,8) This line tells the computer to play the sound "groove" on track 2 starting at measure 1 and ending at measure 8.

. Change the starting measure from 1 to 3: `fitMedia(groove,2,3,8)`.

. Run your code and play your music. How did this change your music?

. Look at line 21 `fitMedia(melody,3,1,8)`. This line tells the computer to play `melody` on track 3 from measure 1-8.

. Change the end measure of the sound clip to measure 5: `fitMedia(melody,3,1,5)` Run your code and play your music. How did this change your song?

. Continue to adjust starting and ending measures to achieve your desired
sound.


_You cannot play two clips on the same track for overlapping measures. This will
cause a warning in your script and will only play one clip To add another clip, use
another track._

****






[[AddSoundClips]]
=== Adding Sound Clips

EarSketch has an extensive library of sound clips. You can find sound clips from genres such as R&B, Hip Hop , EDM, House, Pop and Funk (and many more) and from over 300 different instrument samples. 

Many of these sound clips have been created by the recording artists and sound engineers: Richard Devine and Young Guru.

_Young Guru_, is a grammy-nominated sound engineer, record producer, disc jockey, and record executive. Young Guru has worked with many lead recording artists including Jay-Z.

_Richard Devine_ is an electronic musician and sound designer famous for producing a layered and heavily processed sound. He has composed scores for commercials and many recordings that have been composed on the computer.

For this competition, we have also added _Ciara’s_ sound clips to the sound library. You can also add your own sound clips (we will show you how to do this in Module 2)

*How to add sound clips*

. Access the sound library by clicking the folder with the headphones just below the EarSketch logo. image:../media/CiaraRemixComp/img9.png[]

. Search for sounds, by artist, genre and instrument. In the sound collections menu, there will also be suggestions for sounds that fit your script or sounds used by others who have searched similar sounds. image:../media/CiaraRemixComp/img10.png[]

. Use the green play button next to the name of the sound clip to listen to it and decide if you want to add it to your script. image:../media/CiaraRemixComp/img11.png[]

. If you decide to add it to your script, use the blue clipboard icon to paste the sound clip into your `fitMedia()` function.

. Define the track, starting measure, and ending measure of your sound clip. Let’s practice in this next activity. `fitMedia(RD_FUTURE_DEBSTEP_PERC_1,6,2,6)`



.Student Activity: Adding Sound Clips
****
Now you will have the opportunity to add some of your own sound clip choices.

. Go to line 25 and type in `fitMedia()`

. Go to your sound browser and search for a sound (maybe one from Ciara) that you think would fit well in this song.

. When you have found your desired sound clip, click the blue clipboard icon to paste it in the `fitMedia()` function.

. The next argument in `fitMedia()` is the track. We are going to assign this sound clip to track

. Place a comma next to your sound clip and then the number `6`

. The next two arguments are start and end measure. Choose a start measure (between 1 and 8) to start playing your music and end measure (between 2 and 9) to end your music. Your end measure must be a larger number than your start measure.

. Check to make sure you have commas between your arguments and have closed your parentheses.

. Click run and play.

. Do you hear your new sound clip? How does it fit in with your song?

. You can continue to add sound clips or change the sound clips in the `fitMedia()` functions from lines 19-24. If you are adding tracks, start at track 10 to avoid overlapping tracks.

[[BuildingBlocksVarsConst]]
=== Variables and Constants

The last two building blocks of our basic script are variables and constants. A constant stores a value that never changes. An example of a constant is our sound clip file `HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002` . This file is assigned to a single value (the sound that it plays).

Variables are a way to store information within a script. Variables can represent anything including numbers and clip names. To use variables, we need to give the variable a name and then assign it a value.

For example, I may want to use the sound file `HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002` multiple times.

It’s a cool beat and I may want to have it loop through the song. Instead of copying and pasting the whole sound clip, I can assign the variable groove to represent that clip ex: `groove=HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002` This will save me time and space in writing my code. It also makes it easier to experiment with different sounds. 

If I decide that `HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002` is not actually the beat I want in my song, and instead I want `RD_FUTURE_DUBSTEP_PERC_1`, I can simply change the groove variable and it will update everywhere that beat is used in the whole song. For example `groove=RD_FUTURE_DUBSTEP_PERC_1`


*Creating Variables*

. Decide what information will be assigned a variable

. Assign the variable a name

. Use the assignment operator `=` to assign your variable a value


[source,python]
----
# Variables
groove = HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002
melody = CIARA_SET_THEME_ATMOS_1
adlib = CIARA_SET_TALK_ADLIB_LOFI_1
Cbeat1 = CIARA_SET_THEME_ATMOS_2
----


In our script, lines 11-15 showed my assigned variables. In line 11, I assigned the variable groove to the value `HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVE_002`. I used the assignment operator `=` to show the connection. Once I have defined the variable, I can use the variable name with my `fitMedia()` function. See below to practice using variables in your script.


.Student Activity:
****
. Edit your sample script to include more variables.

. Create a variable in line 16 for `RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8`

. Choose a name that represents the sound file (e.g. house, beat )

. Use the `=` as your assignment operator

. Assign your variable the value `RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8`

. Go to your `fitMedia()` function on line 19. Delete `RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8` and replace it with the name of your variable.

. Run your code and hit play. Did your code run? Does your music sound the same? If the answer is yes, you have defined your variable correctly.
