== Looping
:nofooter:

Repetition is an important element of music. Computers can execute statements over and over again using a *loop*. In this chapter, we will learn about loops, using them to code more efficiently and add repetition to our music.

=== The For-Loop

[role="curriculum-python"]
A *for-loop* tells the computer to execute a section of code repeatedly, a common notation in most programming languages. We can use for-loops to avoid repeated lines or sections of code. In Python, for-loops look like this:

=== Components of a For-Loop

[role="curriculum-python"]
For-loops in Python consist of 3 basic parts:

For-loops in JavaScript consist of 4 basic parts:

[role="curriculum-python"]
* *Loop Body*: The body of a loop contains statements that will execute repeatedly. It includes everything that is *indented* (using the _tab_ key) directly after the colon `:`.
* *Loop Counter*: Creates a variable to be used as a loop counter.
* *Range*: A function that makes a list of numbers for the loop counter to count through. The keyword `in` checks if the loop counter value is in the specified range. `range()` takes two arguments, a starting point (inclusive) and ending point (exclusive): `range(startingNumber, endingNumber)`.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
* *Loop Body*: The body of a loop contains statements that will execute repeatedly. It is surrounded by curly braces `{ }`.
* *Initialization*: This creates a variable to be used as a *loop counter* before the first loop runs.
* *Iteration statement*: A statement that updates the loop counter. It counts up on each iteration.
* *Loop Condition*: This checks whether the loop should run again. If the statement is true, the loop body executes again. If the counter gets too high, the statement will be false, and we exit the loop. The computer then continues executing code after the loop.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
.CODE BLOCKS
****
A code block in JavaScript is a group of statements meant to be run together. It is usually placed between curly braces `{ }`. For-loops use them to show what code will be looped.
****

[role="curriculum-python"]
.INDENTATION
****
In Python, indentation affects how code is executed. The statements inside the for-loop body should be tabbed in from the first line and have the same indentation level. Python will not recognize unindented code as part of the loop, so the loop ends when the indentation ends.
****

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
.INDENTATION
****
Indentation does not affect how code is executed in JavaScript, but it is very important to keep code human-readable. By convention, the statements inside a for-loop body should have the same indentation level by convention, usually tabbed in from the first line.
****

[role="curriculum-python"]
Let's use a for-loop to repeat the makeBeat() pattern that we created in the previous chapter. By adding one more line of code and indenting the body, we can loop the beat four times to create four measures of music. In the following sections, we will examine for-loops in more detail.

[role="curriculum-python"]
In the example above, we create a loop counter, `measure`, to place music through a series of measures. We also specify a range function `range(1, 9)`, so our for-loop will count through the list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Notice 9 is not included in this list. This is because the `range()` functions's `endingNumber` is exclusive, meaning its number is not included in the list. `startNumber`, on the other hand, is inclusive. This for-loop is saying "keep looping until we count through all the numbers created by the range function." In this case, the range function we specified lets us place music up to (but not including) measure 9.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
In the example above, we set the initialization variable `measure` equal to 1, so we can start placing music at measure 1. We want to place music up to measure 9 (but not including measure 9), so we set a loop condition `measure < 9`, meaning "keep looping until we get to measure 9." The iteration statement, `measure = measure + 1` increases the value of measure by 1 on each iteration. When this count reaches 9, the loop condition is no longer true, so we exit the loop.

[[followingcontrolflow]]
=== Following Control Flow
The *interpreter* reads and executes a script. The order it is executed in is called the *control flow*. It usually goes line by line, top to bottom. A loop is a *control flow statement*, which changes the order. At the end of a loop body, it jumps back to the top of the loop

The following animation shows how the control flow moves when a for-loop is encountered, and how the value of the loop counter changes on each *iteration*, or repetition of the loop body:

Although it is valid syntax, a `*monospace bold phrase*` causes a build error in AsciidocFX. Might be something to do with DocBook conversion. No bold for now. May see how ES handles it in the future.

.INCREMENTING AND DECREMENTING
****
You may want to increment or decrement a variable like how the loop counter does on each iteration of a loop. Instead of writing something like `measure = measure + 1`, you can use the shorthand `+=` and `-=`.

* `measure += 1`
** This adds one to the variable's current value. You can increment by any other number by changing the value to the right of the expression.
* `measure -=1`
** This subtracts one from the variable. You can also decrement by any other number.
****

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
.INCREMENTING AND DECREMENTING
****
The following is a shorthand method for incrementing (or decrementing) a counter:

* `measure++`
** This adds 1 to the current value of `measure`. It has the exact same meaning as `measure = measure + 1`, but is faster to write.
* `measure--`
** This subtracts 1 from the current value of `measure`.

We can use `+=` or `-=` as a shorthand to increment or decrement by a different number. For example:

* `measure += 2`
** This adds two to the current value of `measure`. You can also increment by any other number.
* `measure -= 2`
** This subtracts 2 from `measure`.

=== Adding Effects with Loops

Repeatedly adding media clips to a project is just one of many possible uses of for-loops in EarSketch. In the following video and example code, we use two loops to add clips to the DAW, and a third to add a panning effect on each track. Note: panning effects are more noticeable when using headphones.

// for-loop to create alternating drum beat

    fitMedia(drums1, 1, measure, measure + 0.5);
    fitMedia(drums2, 2, measure + 0.5, measure + 1);

    panAmount = 200 * (track - 1) / 3 - 100;
    setEffect(track, PAN, LEFT_RIGHT, panAmount);
}
----

The first for-loop in the script above is used to create an alternating drum beat. This looping technique results in the first drum sound playing only over the first half of each measure on track one. The second drum sound follows over the second half of each measure on track two. This gives us independent control of panning for each track. Staggering sounds with a for-loop is also an excellent way to vary a beat.

The second for-loop automates track panning. It results in the sound file sending sounds to our left ear, right ear, or a combination. With each iteration, the loop steps through the four tracks and calculates a pan position, ranging from "hard" left (-100) to "hard" right (100) and two places between (-33 and 33). This gives the individual sounds their own "space" in the stereo field, which can create a sense of depth and movement in our compositions.

=== Automating Effects with Loops

For-loops can be used to apply repeated effects envelopes to tracks. In the example below, each iteration of the loop adds a one measure long segment of the envelope. Automating the GAIN parameter creates rhythmic volume fades, an effect popular in EDM. Try toggling the effect bypass to hear the difference the effect makes.
