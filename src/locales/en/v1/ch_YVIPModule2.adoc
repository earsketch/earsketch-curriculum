Welcome to Module 2 of the Your Voice Is Power Learning Experience. You will continue to investigate how music, computer science, and entrepreneurship are pathways to promote racial equity, and  gain skills to help you code your final song for the competition.

In this module, you will examine “layers”, both the layers that work together to create racism and the instrumental layers that combine to create music. You will use what you learn to code instrumental layers in your song.

[[MessagingintheMusic]]

=== Messaging in the Music

Let's look at the lyrics to get started. Click on the link below to listen and think about Pharrell’s meaning behind these lines. Ask questions like “Who is he talking about”, “If there is an action, who is doing it or affected by it?”, “Who is he talking to and what information is he trying to give them?”, “Are there words or phrases that can have more than one meaning?”.  As you listen to the clip, think about the themes from https://earsketch.gatech.edu/yvip/Module-2-Student-Notebook.pdf[Dr. Wilson’s OUTKAST Imagination Framework^]

https://earsketch.gatech.edu/yvip/Entrepreneur-Verse1.m4a[Entrepreneur - Verse1^]

* In this position with no choice
* A system imprison young black boys
* Distract with white noise
* The brainwashed become hype boys
* Third eye dilate
* You ain't supposed to make it off Section 8
* Robbin' Peter just to pay Paul
* Prepare to risk everything

What message did you hear as you listened to the verse?
Did you recognize themes of Truthtelling and Accountability from  the OUTKAST Imagination framework in the song?
How does the music/instrumentals add another layer to the message?

*Let's listen to Dr. Wilson analyze the lyrics:*

Did you guess the right meaning?  Did you know the origins of Trap music?  *Lyric analysis and messaging can provide you with new knowledge about your favorite songs.*


[[DefiningTypesofRacism]]

=== Defining Types of Racism

We want for you to continue to build your knowledge about the themes of equity, entrepreneurship, and racism throughout this experience.  The more knowledge you have on these topics, the easier it will be for you to code your message in your song.

We have defined racism, but now it is time to pull back the layers (just like the layers of a song) and define the types of racism.

*There are 3 types of racism:  interpersonal racism,  institutional racism, and systemic or structural racism.*

* *Interpersonal racism*  occurs between individuals as personal interactions. It is the exercise of personal prejudice that demeans, hurts, or harms communities of color.
** An example of interpersonal racism is the use of a racial slur or an insensitive racial comment.
* *Institutional racism* occurs within institutions and systems of power. It describes the unfair policies and discriminatory practices of particular institutions (schools, workplaces, etc.) that routinely produce racially inequitable outcomes for people of color.
** An example of institutional racism would be a school’s policy to suspend Black girls who wear braids in their hair.
* *Structural/systemic racism* is racial bias among institutions and across society. This involves the cumulative and compounding effects of an array of societal factors, including the history, culture, ideology, and interactions of institutions and policies that systematically privilege White people and disadvantage people of color.”
** An example of structural racism is "redlining," a system once used by banks and the real estate industry that literally outlined the neighborhoods where people of color lived in red ink. If you lived inside the red lines, banks were less likely to give loans or invest.”

Think about how you could incorporate messages about the different types of racism in your song.  Remember, it’s not just words that tell a message but the instrumentals too.  You can use contrasting sounds, volume, and different beats to communicate a message in your song.

[[LayersofMusic]]

=== Layers of Music

Let’s explore how to use sounds and instruments to communicate a message in music.  Most songs layer different instruments and sounds to create a desired harmony.  Can you guess how many different and sounds were used to create the “Entrepreneur” song?


Let’s find out! Watch the following video:

[.youtube-container]
video::jXI7rQeT2j0[youtube]


Can you believe how many layers of instruments and sounds were used to create the song? So awesome! Today, you are going to learn how to do exactly what Chalece did. You will import sounds into your song and use the function `fitMedia()` to code at least 5 tracks to create a short song.

[[StartingYourSong]]

=== Starting Your Song


It’s time to start your song by creating a new script to code your “Your Voice Is Power” Song”   Below we provided  an outline for your song.  Click the blue clipboard icon to copy the code in the box below into your code editor. *When it pastes in the code editor, click import to edit.*

This will be your script to submit to the “Your Voice is Power” competition. * _(If you are an experienced EarSketch user, you can create and outline your own script.)_

Fill your DJ code name as the author and you are ready to get started coding and composing.

[[CreatingYourSoundBank]]

=== Creating Your Sound Bank

Now that you have the outline of your script, let’s add some music.  EarSketch has audio stems from genres such as R&B, Hip Hop, EDM, House, Pop and Funk (and many more),
and from over 300 different instrument samples. In addition to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharrell_Williams[Pharrell^], we have sound slips
from recording artists and sound engineers such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara[Ciara^], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(rapper)[Common^], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Devine[Richard Devine^], and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Guru[Young Guru^]. _(Click on the artists’ name to learn more about their music)_

Our first step is create a `#SOUNDBANK` with all our favorite sounds that we will use during our song.  Your `#SOUNDBANK` will be like a closet that holdsfavorite sound clips.  You will get to go into that closet and place those sounds in your song when and where you want them. Most songs include at least one sound from 5 main categories:

* SteadyBeat - drum beats and percussion loops
* Bass - Deep and low sounding instruments
* Harmony - “steady” toned instruments without much action, like strings
* Melody - the main tune of the song, often able to be sung.
* Sound Effects(SFX) - fun accents or “bells and whistles” that happen occasionally in a song for emphasis.

Time to listen to and choose  some great beats.




***

*_Student Activity: Explore the Sound Browser_*

. Access the sound browser by clicking the folder with the headphones just below the EarSketch logo.
. Search for sounds, by artist, genre and instrument.  In the sound collections menu, there will also be suggestions for sounds that fit your script or sounds used by others who have searched similar sounds. Sound clips from “Entrepreneur” will be listed at the top of the Sound Collection
. Use the green play button next to the name of the sound clip to listen to it and decide if you like it.
. If you like the sound and want   to add it to your script, use the blue clipboard icon to paste the sound clip into your code editor
. Add five sound clips to your sound bank.  Think about the different instruments you heard in the entrepreneur song. Can you add some different sounds?

[Sound bank :Variables and constants]

==== Variables and Constants

We hope you had fun listening to the awesome beats in the sound browser.   Were you able to choose just two favorite sounds and paste them in the code editor?   Look at your sound bank.  Do some of the sounds you chose have pretty long names.  For example, one of our favorite drum sounds has the name: ENTREP_BEAT_DRUMBEAT.   This would be a lot to type over and over again in our script.  It would be a lot easier if this sound had a nickname.  Luckily, we can use *variables* to give our favorite sounds nicknames.  This allows us to use them over and over again in our code without having to type such a long name (it also keeps us from making spelling errors).

_A *variable* is a unit of storage that can be changed to represent a value. To use variables, we need to give the variable a name and assign it to a value._

Example:

`*drum=ENTREP_BEAT_DRUMBEAT*`

We want to use our favorite drum sound: `ENTREP_BEAT_DRUMBEAT` multiple times in our song.  Instead of copying and pasting the whole sound clip, I can use a variable to represent that clip.  This will save me time and space in writing my code.  I’ll assign  the variable - *drum to `ENTREP_BEAT_DRUMBEAT*`.  The variable is defined using the = as an assignment operator. Whenever I want to use the `*ENTREP_BEAT_DRUMBEAT*`,  I can now use it’s nickname or variable - *drum*.


Look at your `#SOUNDBANK` in your code editor.  It’s time to assign these clips to some variables.

***
*_Student Activity: Creating Variables_*

1. Assign the  soundclip a variable name or nickname  (usually the name connects to the sound, just like a nickname is connected to your full name)
2. Use the assignment operator =  to assign your variable a value.  Ex. `drum=ENTREP_BEAT_DRUMBEAT`
3. Complete for each sound clip in your `#SOUNDBANK`
3. <<building-blocks#variables,Click here>> to learn more about variables
 and review your sample script from Module 1 to see an example of a `#SOUNDBANK`.

[[AddingSoundClips]]

=== Adding Sound Clips

We have our sounds and even assigned them cool nicknames (or variables).  Now, you should be ready to remix them in your song.  In order to add a sound clip in EarSketch, we use the function fitMedia(). A function is a piece of code that you can easily call
over and over again.”  The  fitMedia() function adds an audio files to a specified track at specific start and end times. Using fitMedia on its own won’t automatically play the music.  You will need to provide the arguments  in order for the computer to know what to do.

image:../media/YVIP-RemixComp/Mod2-Image-3-fitMedia.png[]

*fitMedia() function takes in four input arguments:*

* *Sound clip name*: The sound clip placed in the Digital Audio Workstation
* *trackNumber*: Track on which music is placed
* *startLocation*: The measure at which the sound clip will start
* *endLocation*: The measure at which the sound clip will end

Ex. `fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8,1,1,5)`

***
*_Student Activity: Adding Sound Clips_*

_You can now add sound clips to code `#verse 1` of your song._

1. Find the  `#verse1` in your script. Click enter to type on the next line
2. Type `fitMedia()` in your code editor.
3. Choose a sound from your `#SOUNDBANK` and enter the variable name as your first argument.  Place a comma after the variable name.
4. Enter “*1*” as your trackNumber. Place a comma after the track number.
5. Enter “*1*” as your startMeasure.  Place a comma after the startMeasure
6. Enter “*5*” as your endMeasure. Close your parentheses.
7. Click Run and Play.
8. You have coded your first piece of music. How does it sound?
9. Repeat this process for four more sound clips.  Remember each sound clip needs to be on a different track (2,3,4 etc) and the ending measure must be a larger number than your starting measure.  You can stagger your starting and ending measures as you wish.
10. If you want to add sound clips directly from the sound browser,  you can click the blue clipboard icon to paste it directly in the `fitMedia()` function.
***

Remember to check that you have commas between each argument and close your parentheses.
Run and play your song often to hear your beats.  If you need additional support, check out the EarSketch chapter on <<getting-started#composinginearsketch,Composing in EarSketch>>.  You can review lines 23-28 of your sample script.





*Congratulations, you have successfully completed Module 2 and are officially a code DJ!*

_You have learned:_

* Racial Injustice takes place interpersonally, institutionally, and structurally.
* Songs are created by layering many different sounds/instruments (tracks)
* A variable is a unit of storage that creates a space in the computer’s memory to
