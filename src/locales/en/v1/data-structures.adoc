=== Data Structure Basics

[role="curriculum-python"]
A *list* is a collection of values combined into a single entity. They enable a single variable to store multiple items that can be easily retrieved. These items, referred to as list *elements*, can be any data type. We have seen lists created by the `range()` function previously. Now, we focus on manually created lists, using brackets (`[]`).

JAF: There used to be a nice figure in here that showed how a list and list indices work. We need to make something aligned to the example below and add it in here.

Much of the content in the next paragraph was covered in Ch. 13 for strings, like indices, len() function, and JS methods. Thus, this section is drastically shorter.

Elements stored in a list get assigned an index, just like the characters of a string. Refer to <<string-operations#substrings, Chapter 13>> for a detailed explanation of indices. List indices start at `0` and end at `length - 1`. The `len()` function can be used to obtain the length of a list. Individual elements of a list can be accessed by using square bracket notation (`[]`) along with an index. This same notation can be used to modify any list element.

Array indices start at `0` and end at `length-1`. The `length` field can be used to obtain the length of an array, like `myArray.length`.

The following example shows how to store items as list elements and retrieve them with bracket notation. A list containing sound clips is initialized. Then, these elements are retrieved in a series of `fitMedia()` calls.

=== Iterating Through a Data Structure

[role="curriculum-python"]
For-loops are a convenient way to read through a list from first to last index. The loop in the following example reads through `myList` and prints each string element in order. The `len()` function is used to determine how many loops are needed to iterate through the whole list.

The next example shows how to create an additive introduction in EarSketch in which instruments (tracks) are added to the music one by one. This is commonly used for a song's introduction. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L53gjP-TtGEKanye[Kanye West's "Power"^], a great example of this structure. The `track` and `mediaIndex` variables are related to `measure` through variable assignment, allowing them to be iterated on each loop. Remember, indices are 0 based, so `mediaIndex` must be `measure - 1`.

=== Using Data Structures with makeBeat

[role="curriculum-python"]
`makeBeat()` has the ability to handle multiple clips at once, allowing a single function call to trigger multiple samples. Passing in a beat string containing numbers 0 through 9 points `makeBeat()` to the list index of the corresponding sample. All clips must be stored in the same list to use this functionality. Check out the example below to see `makeBeat()` in action.

* A *list* is a collection of values combined into a single entity, an efficient way to store data. Items stored within a list, or elements, can be any data type.
* Like strings, list elements get assigned an index. List indices start at 0.
* List elements are accessed with bracket notation, like myList[1].
* `makeBeat()` can construct rhythms from multiple clips at once by passing in a beat string that refers to different list indices. `makeBeat()` can access clips in indices 0 through 9, provided they are stored in the same list.
