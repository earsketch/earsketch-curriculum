*What is Programming?*

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Programming* is the process of writing instructions that a computer uses to perform tasks. These instructions are written in a very specific format called *code*. When a programmer writes a program in code, the computer executes the code one line at a time until it reaches the end. With good programming skills and knowledge, you can write code that can create almost anything imaginable.
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Computers can only understand problems in a very specific way. In order to produce a program that a computer will be able to understand and run, a problem needs to be broken down into many small steps. In turn, these steps must be written in code of the appropriate language and in the explicit order in which the computer should complete them.
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
There are many different types of programming languages that consist of particular and unique terms, phrases, and conventions. The set of rules that define the combination of symbols that are used within a certain language is called that language’s *syntax*. Every language, including English, has a different syntax and, therefore, must be written differently to accomplish correct form. For example, in English, we capitalize proper nouns and add punctuation to the ends of our sentences as a part of the syntax of the language. There are different and specific syntax rules for all of the different types of programming languages. Some of the most popular programming languages used today are Java, JavaScript, Python, and C.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[[programmingtermspython]]
*Programming Terms*
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Array*:: A named collection of objects, where each object is identified by an index. The items within an array can be of any data type (e.g. int, str, float). Example:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
var array = [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3];
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
* the value of array[0] is 1
* the value of array[1] is 1.5
* the value of array[4] is 3
[role="curriculum-javascript"]

After being created, it is possible to change elements of an array by reassigning the different indices to different values. For example, if you have the array above, you could change the first element at index 0 in the following way:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
array[0] = 5;
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Now the first element is no longer 1. It is 5.
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Boolean*:: A variable data type that stores a value that is either `true` or `false`.
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Commenting*:: Comments are sections of code that the computer does not execute. These sections are made for the programmer to explain portions of code in order to make his or her program more readable to himself or herself and to other people. In JavaScript, comments are denoted with `//`. Any text after a `//` is considered to be a comment. Multi-line comments act the same way as single line comments, but they must begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. Example:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
// This is a comment

/*
this is a multi-line comment
it extends across multiple lines
*/
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Conditional*:: A type of statement that checks to see if an argument is true or false before executing some amount of code. Types of conditionals are if-statements, else-if-statements and else-statements. For example:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
if (x < 0) {
    println("Negative.");
} else if (x == 0) {
    println("Neither positive nor negative");
} else {
    println("Positive.");
}
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
This code reads as: if the variable x (defined elsewhere in code) is less than zero, print negative. However, if the parameter x equals zero, it is neither positive nor negative. Otherwise, x is positive.
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Object*:: A collection of key-value pairs that maps from keys to values (often called a map or dictionary in other programming languages). Example:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
var greetings = {
    hello: ["hola"],
    goodbye: ["adios"],
};

println(greetings.hello);
println(greetings.goodbye);
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
`hello` and `goodbye` are keys whereas `hola` and `adios` are values. To get a value from one of the object's keys (called a "property" in JavaScript), you write the object's name followed by a dot and the key: `object.key`
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Function*:: A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take in parameters. Each call you make to the EarSketch API is called a function call. This calls for the code that defines that function to execute.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
// defining a function
function myFunction(string) {
    println(string);
}

// calling a function
myFunction("hello world");

// the result is that 'hello world' gets printed to the EarSketch console
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Index*:: An integer variable or value that indicates an element of an array. The first element of an array has an index of zero.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
// an example array of colors
var list = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"];

// call the value at index 2
println(list[2]);
// expect: 'green'

// assign a new value to index 2
list[2] = "orange";

// print index 2 again
println(list[2]);
// expect: 'orange'
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Keyword*:: A reserved word that is used by JavaScript to parse the program; you cannot use keywords as variable names. (A list of JavaScript keywords are available after this section).
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Loop*:: A statement or group of statements that execute repeatedly until a terminating condition is satisfied. There are two main types of loops: a for-loop and a while-loop. For-loop:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    println("Hello");
}
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
The above code prints “Hello” once for each number in the range between 1 and 9. For-loops are useful if there is a specific number of items that you wish to iterate over. While-loop:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
var n = 5;

while (n > 0) {
    println(n);
    n = n - 1;
}
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
The above code first checks to see if n is greater than zero. If this is true, n is printed and then decremented by 1. The loop continues to execute until the condition that n is greater than zero is false. While loops are useful if you do not have a specific set of items to iterate through. In any situation, a for loop can be written as a while loop and vice versa. It is ultimately up to the programmer to choose which will work best for any given situation.
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Number*:: A JavaScript data type that consists of both integers and floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers have decimal components. Note that integers and floating-point numbers are not different data types in JavaScript, as they are in many other languages (they are called "literals"). Examples:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
// Floating point numbers
var a = 0.5;
var b = -2.0;
var c = 6.67;

// Integers
var d = 50;
var e = 0;
var f = -12;
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Parameter*:: A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument. For example, in the function `setTempo(tempo)`, tempo is the parameter.
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*Return*:: The return keyword signals to the program that the end of a function has been reached. When a return statement is executed, the currently running function will terminate. The function can simply return with no output, or it can return a value. A function will automatically return after executing all of its statements, even if `return` is not written. For example:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
function add(x, y) {
    var result = x + y;
    return result;
}
----
[role="curriculum-javascript"]
The above code will return the sum of x and y.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
*String*:: A JavaScript data type that holds characters. A character can be a letter, number, space, punctuation, or symbol. Examples:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
var myString = "This is a string!";
var myOtherString = "$tring...";
----

These sections are made for the programmer to explain portions of code in order to make his or her program more readable to himself or herself and to other people. In Python, comments are denoted with `#` . Any text after a `#` is considered to be a comment. Multi-line comments act the same way as single line comments, but they must have three single quote marks at the beginning and end of the comment. Example:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
# This is a comment

"""
this is a multi-line comment
it extends across multiple lines
"""
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Conditional*:: A type of statement that checks to see if an argument is True or False before executing some amount of code. Types of conditionals are if-statements, elif-statements, and else-statements. For example: 

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
if x < 0:
    print("Negative.")
elif x == 0:
    print("Neither positive nor negative")
else:
    print("Positive.")
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
This code reads as: if the variable x (defined elsewhere in code) is less than zero, print negative. However, if the parameter x equals zero, it is neither positive nor negative. Otherwise, x is positive.
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Dictionary*:: A collection of key-value pairs that maps from keys to values. Example:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
{"hello": "hola", "goodbye": "adios"}
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
`hello` and`goodbye` are keys whereas `hola` and `adios` are values.
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Float*:: A Python data type that stores floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers have decimal components. Examples:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
0.5, 2.0, 6.67
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Function*:: A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take in parameters. Each call you make to the EarSketch API is called a function call. This calls for the code that defines that function to execute.

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
# defining a function
def myFunction(string):
    print(string)

# calling a function
myFunction("hello world")

# the result is that 'hello world' gets printed to the EarSketch console
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Import*:: A statement which permits functions and variable defined in a Python script to be brought into the environment of another script. For instance, we use the EarSketch API, so we must import that script into each project in the following way:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
from earsketch import *
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Index*:: An integer variable or value that indicates an element of a list. The first element of a list has an index of zero.

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
# an example list of colors
list = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]

# call the value at index 2
print(list[2])
# expect: 'green'

# assign a new value to index 2
list[2] = "orange"

# print index 2 again
list[2]
# expect: 'orange'
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
*int*:: A Python data type that holds positive and negative whole numbers. Examples:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
5, -50, 5834
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Keyword*:: A reserved word that is used by Python to parse the program; you cannot use keywords as variable names.
[role="curriculum-python"]
*List*:: A named collection of objects, where each object is identified by an index. The items within a list can be of any data type (e.g. int, str, float). Example:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
list = [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
* the value of list[0] is 1
* the value of list[1] is 1.5
* the value of list[4] is 3
[role="curriculum-python"]

After being created, it is possible to change elements of a list by reassigning the different indices to different values. For example, if you have the list above, you could change the first element at index 0 in the following way:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
list[0] = 5
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
Now the first element is no longer 1. It is 5.
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Loop*:: A statement or group of statements that execute repeatedly until a terminating condition is satisfied. There are two types of loops: a for-loop and a while-loop. For-loop:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
for i in range(1, 10):
    print("Hello")
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
The above code prints “Hello” once for each number in the range between 1 and 9. For-loops are useful if there is a specific number of items that you wish to iterate over. While-loop:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
n = 5

while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n - 1
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
The above code first checks to see if n is greater than zero. If this is True, n is printed and then decremented by 1. The loop continues to execute until the condition that n is greater than zero is False. While-loops are useful if you do not have a specific set of items to iterate through. In any situation, a for loop can be written as a while-loop and vice versa. It is ultimately up to the programmer to choose which will work best for any given situation.
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Parameter*:: A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument. For example, in the function `setTempo(tempo)`, tempo is the parameter.
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Range*:: The range function is a function that is built into Python. The key to using the range function is to remember that the beginning point is inclusive and the ending point is exclusive. By this, we mean that if you wish for a range of numbers between 1 and 10, the corresponding range function would be `range(1,11)`. The 1 will be included (inclusive) and the 11 will be excluded (exclusive). An optional third parameter that can be passed into the range function signifies the step used. For instance, if you wanted your values to be only every third number in a range, you would add a 3 as the third parameter. Examples:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
range(10)  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

range(10, 15)  # [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

range(0, 10, 2)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
----
[role="curriculum-python"]
*Return*:: The return keyword signals to the program that the end of a function has been reached. When a return statement is executed, the currently running function will terminate. The function can simply return with no output, or it can return a value. For example:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
def add(x, y):
    result = x + y
    return result
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
The above code will return the sum of x and y.
[role="curriculum-python"]
*str*:: A Python data type that holds characters. A character can be a letter, number, space, punctuation, or symbol. Examples:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
myString = "This is a string!"
myOtherString = "$tring..."
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
*tuple*:: A data type that contains a set of elements of any type, like a list.

[role="curriculum-python"]
[[pythonkeywords]]
*Python Keywords*
[role="curriculum-python"]
These are terms that are reserved by the Python interpreter. This means that they can't be used as variable or function names in your script, because Python expects them to mean particular things already.
