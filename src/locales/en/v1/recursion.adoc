AW: there are a lot of combinations of apostrophes, single quotes, and back quotes in this section--it's hard for me to tell if these are supposed to be codified (`01`), quoted ("01"), abbreviated ('01), or some combination of them...I'm guessing, since we're mostly talking about strings, it's supposed to be single quotes ('01'), but could you confirm?

=== What is a Fractal?

In this module, we introduce an important concept in both computer science and artistic practice: the idea of *self-similarity*, and its related programming technique *recursion*. Self-similarity is when a part of an object is similar to the entire object.

A common property of self-similar designs, which are sometimes called *fractals*, is that they contain the same pattern at various levels.

The four pictures below are examples of a popular fractal design known as the *Mandelbrot Set*.

Exciting examples of self-similarity can be discovered throughout the Mandelbrot Set. Looking at the first picture, notice the part outlined in the white rectangle…

=== What is Recursion? (Part 1)

In computer science, one of the main ways that self-similarity is shown is through a technique called recursion. Recursion is found whenever a function calls itself from within the body of its own code. In the example function `countdown()` below, we can see at that it calls itself from within its own body of code. This means that `countdown()` is a *recursive function*, and the call inside itself is a *recursive call*.

# Simple Recursion: Counting down from 3 with recursion

# Setup
from earsketch import *
setTempo(120)

# Body
def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        print("GO!")
        return
    print(n)
    countdown(n - 1)

countdown(3)

// Body
function countdown(n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        println("GO!");
        return;
    }
    println(n);
    countdown(n - 1);
}

countdown(3);
----


In order to understand how recursion works, it’s helpful first to distinguish in your mind the difference between:

. The definition of a function in code (in an EarSketch script, for example)
. The actual running of that function (whenever the function is called).

A function can have only one valid definition, but may have an unlimited number of calls to it within a script. `countdown()` is a good first example of recursion, because it clearly shows the main elements of what is needed for recursion to work properly.

First of all, everything that happens directly within a function call is said to be within that function’s *scope*. This includes local variable definitions, but does not include what may happen inside any other function that is called within its body.

Using `countdown()` as an example, an integer parameter n is passed in. This parameter is now within the scope of this particular call of `countdown()`.

In the first line of the function, this parameter n is tested to see if it is equal to zero. This is called the *stopping condition*.

If the stopping condition turns out to be True (here it’s when n is equal to zero), then that particular call of `countdown()` returns immediately, passing control back to whatever scope called it. This is either another function or the "top level" of code that is written in the script, outside the scope of any function.

If the stopping condition is False, print is called, which prints the value of n.

A working stopping condition is always needed. If the stopping condition fails to cause the function to return when it should, it could run forever and will crash the program. This is why the stopping condition is tested each time the function is called, and must evaluate to True at some point (e.g. n must equal zero at some point). This insures that at some point the most recent recursive function call will return, and start the chain reaction that will return each recursive call back up to the initially called function, which returns with the final result.

`countdown(n-1)` is a clear example of a recursive call. Here, `countdown()` calls itself and passes `n – 1` in as its integer parameter. This new call to `countdown()` is within its own newly created scope, which is fully separate from the scope of the particular use of `countdown()` which called it.

If this sounds confusing, then look at the definition of `countdown()`, follow it line by line and imagine what it does, while also referring to the two diagrams below. When you see what is going on here, you’ll understand this process of recursion.

Now for a concrete example:

When the code example above is run as an EarSketch script, the function definition of `countdown()` is first processed. Then, this very function is called from the "top level" of code. Thus, `countdown(3)` is called directly from the "top level" of code, outside the scope of any other function.

Since n equals 3 here and not zero, this number 3 is printed to the EarSketch console on its own line, and then `countdown()` calls itself, passing in a parameter of 2… (n - 1). The highest level scope of `countdown()` (which just made the recursive call to itself) is actually not finished yet, since control has passed to the recursive call of `countdown()`, in the function’s definition. Thus, the highest level of `countdown()` is actually waiting for the recursive call it just made to return.

As we stated above, this recursive call to `countdown()` is passed a parameter of 2 (n minus 1, since n in the highest level scope of `countdown()` is equal to 3).

Now the whole process repeats:

2 is not equal to zero, so it’s printed on its own line, and then is decremented by one and passed into a new recursive call of `countdown()`. Now we have n = 1 as the input to this third level of `countdown()`.

1 is not equal to zero, so it’s printed, and is then decremented by one and passed into a new recursive call of `countdown()`.

Since n = 0 here at last, the stopping condition test in returns True, and that particular call of `countdown()` immediately returns to the one that called it (which is the next higher scope of `countdown()`, one level up).

This higher scope of `countdown()` then immediately returns to the scope that called it. This keeps happening until the initial `countdown()` function call returns to the scope which called it, which is the "top level" of code in the EarSketch script, outside of any function.

By viewing the output of `countdown(3)` in the picture below, and also the diagram below that which shows the flow of control starting from the original call to `countdown(3)`, you can see what recursion is all about. Once you understand its basic operation, you will know how recursion works at its core.

One more quick term: The parameter n that is passed into the original call to `countdown()`, can be thought of here as the *depth of recursion*. This is because there are n recursive calls between the top level function call and the very last one which returns because its input parameter of n is equal to zero.

This is what `countdown(3)` shows in the console when run from an EarSketch script:

[[optionallessons]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/unit9.png[Alt Text]

This is an illustration of what is happening in the computer when a recursive function like `countdown(3)`is called from code:

[[recursiontesttree]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/recursionTestTree.png[Alt Text]

Note that any two commands on a row (`countdown()`, `return`) belong to the same scope, while each separate row belongs to its own separate scope.

=== What is Recursion? (Part 2)
[role="curriculum-python"]


[role="curriculum-javascript"]

Now that we understand the basics of recursion, it’s time to see how we can use recursion to make music with EarSketch.

In the example function `placeSounds()` below, we see that it calls itself from within its own body of code.

This means that `placeSounds()` is a *recursive function*, and the inner call to itself is a *recursive call*.

Whenever we use the term "sound", we just mean an audio clip (e.g.`placeSounds()`means "place audio clips").

`*placeSounds()*` works like this:

* You supply it with a list of audio clips and a start measure location

* It places the first audio clip in the list on track 1 at the start measure location, and ends the clip one measure later

* It then calls a new run of itself, supplying as parameters:

** the remaining audio clips in the list (every audio clip in the list except the first one, which was the one just placed)
** its start measure location increased by one measure

This keeps "recursing" until there are no more audio clips in the list, at which point the stopping condition tests True and the work of the function has ended.

Let’s examine specifically what happens when we call `placeSounds()` from code, with a list of four audio clips and a start measure location of 1 (see diagram below):

[[placesound]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/placeSound.png[Alt Text]

As shown by the above diagram, the first thing that happens is that `clipA` is placed at measure 1 (on track 1), and ends one measure later.

Then a recursive call is made to the same function, supplying as parameters a shortened audio clip list (`[clipB, clipC, clipD]`), and the just-used start measure location increased by 1 (which becomes 2).
Now `clipB` is placed at measure 2 (which is the value of the start parameter that was provided to this particular call of `placeSounds()`), and ends one measure later. A new recursive call is made,supplying as parameters a further-shortened audio clip list (`[clipC, clipD]`), and the start measure location increased again by 1 (which becomes 3 here). Next, `clipC` is placed at measure 3 and ends one measure later. Another recursive call is made, supplying as parameters a further-shortened audio clip list (`[clipD]`), and the updated start measure location (which becomes 4). The last audio clip of the original list,`clipD`, is placed at measure 4 (and ends one measure later).

Another recursive call is made, supplying as parameters: an empty list, and the updated start measure location (which becomes 5 -- although this is never used… see the next line below).

Now, since an empty list has been provided for the `soundlist` parameter, the test of the code becomes *True*, and the function immediately returns. This causes the function that called it to return as well, which causes the function that called that one to return, etc… all the way back to the original function call from code, which finally returns (see the above diagram for a clear depiction of this process).

In general, a recursive function works something like this:

* The function is called from code, with its required parameter(s) as input
* One of the input parameters is tested to see if it is equal to some value (this is called the stopping condition).
* If the result of this test is *true*, the function returns immediately, without running the rest of the code below the stopping condition.
* If the result of this test is *false*, the function keeps on going and runs the rest of its code.
* Assuming the stopping condition has failed, the rest of the code in the function body usually does something like this:
* Perform the main task(s) of the function
* Change the input parameter(s) to new value(s), and supply them as input to a new recursive call of the same function.

Here’s a more complete musical example to run in EarSketch:

*Why not just use for loops?* This is a valid question, because if examples like the above were all we were planning on doing, then for loops would be a more straightforward way to achieve the same thing. Here’s an alternate version of `placeSoundsOnTrack()` that uses iteration instead of recursion:

# notice that the above code is not nearly as elegant as the recursive version shown earlier.

    }

In the next sections, we’ll explore recursive techniques that are much more difficult to implement with for loops and which connect back to the idea of self-similarity and fractals.

.More Information About Recursion
****
One of the basic principles of programming is that the same function may be called multiple times within a code script. When this happens, each of the calls to the same function is run within its own separate scope. Each of these separate function calls runs the same procedure, in its own separate scope with its own set of parameter values as input. In the case of recursion, when a recursive function is called, that same function is called again within a new separate scope, and is called before the parent function ends. We can think of any recursive function call (as it’s running) and its scope as being fully "inside" of the scope of the particular function-call which had called it, like a set of nested Russian dolls. Using this analogy, the largest doll is the original call to the function from code (a call from outside of the function’s definition), while the smallest doll is the final recursive call made – the one that the stopping condition tests True on, which tells that specific call of the function to return. This in turn causes the next-to-last call of the function to return (corresponding to the next larger doll, the one that the smallest doll is directly inside of). One-by-one, each of the recursive function calls return as they cascade upward and out until the original function call returns (the largest doll), and the process is complete.

[[cantorset]]
=== Cantor Set

As a straightforward example of self-similarity that may be used toward great musical effect, consider the Cantor Set shown below.

[[cantor]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/cantor.jpeg[Alt Text]

The steps required to create this self-similar design is as follows:

. Start with a horizontal line segment.
. Make a copy of this line immediately below it,
. Divide the new line into three parts.
. Remove the middle of the three parts -as shown in the first two steps of the diagram above, we change from a single solid line to two smaller lines with a space in the middle.
. For each of the two lines just made, repeat from step 2 above

That’s it! That is all one needs to know (either a human or a computer) in order to create the full design of the Cantor Set.

To apply this design toward an arrangement of sound clips in EarSketch, we can use the line-by-line pattern of a Cantor Set to specify where sound clips should be placed on consecutive EarSketch tracks, yielding something like this:

[[cantorscreen]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/CantorScreen.png[Alt Text]

As part of the code example for this section, we’ve created a function that places sound clips on consecutive tracks in EarSketch, according to the pattern of a Cantor Set.

`makeCantorSet(musicList, 1, 1, 4, 4)`

When calling the above function, we supply it with these parameters:

|=======================
|audioclips |a list of audio clips (one for each track)
|tracknum |the track number we want it to start at
|start |the measure number we want it to start at
|length |the length of the full pattern in bars
|depth |a depth amount
|=======================

The last parameter *depth amount* specifies the total number of tracks we want the function to create, which corresponds to the same number of lines in a Cantor set pattern (see the first diagram at the top).

We see that on lines 19 and 21,`makeCantorSet()` calls itself twice from within itself. Thus `makeCantorSet()` is a *recursive function*, and its calls to itself on lines 19 and 21 are *recursive calls*.

We see that on lines 14 and 15,`makeCantorSet()` calls itself twice from within itself. Thus `makeCantorSet()` is a *recursive function*, and its calls to itself on lines 14 and 15 are *recursive calls*.

Notice that in this example, there is more than one recursive call used within the definition of the function. These two recursive calls correspond to step 5 in the Cantor Set design instructions at the top of the page: one recursive call for each of the two new lines just created in step 4. And since there are _two_ recursive calls here, each _level of recursion_ has two times the number of recursive calls as the preceding level, shown by each level of the Cantor Set pattern – see both diagrams above!

=== Chapter 25 Summary
* Self-similarity refers to a part of an object being similar to the object as a whole.
* Recursion is when a function calls on itself from within the body of code.
* Anything that happens within a function is considered within the function's *scope*.
* A *stopping condition* is what causes a function to stop running.
