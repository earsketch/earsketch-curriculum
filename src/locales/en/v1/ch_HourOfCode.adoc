[[Clips]]
=== Adding Sound Clips

[role="curriculum-python"]
Above the clips is a timeline which displays time in seconds (top) and measures (bottom). Measure is a musical term for a length of time.

[role="curriculum-python"]
The clips are organized in rows, called tracks in EarSketch.

[role="curriculum-python"]
image::../media/HOC/hoc_daw_labeled.png[]

[role="curriculum-python"]
{empty} +

[role="curriculum-python"]
The code that adds the sound clips to the first track is on line 7 in the Code Editor.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Line 7 uses a function called `fitMedia()`. A function is a piece of code that performs an operation. The `fitMedia()` function adds a sound clip to the time line.

[role="curriculum-python"]
A function generally requires parameters in order to know precisely what you want to do. The `fitMedia()` function takes in four input parameters:

[role="curriculum-python"]
* sound clip
* track number
* start measure
* end measure

[role="curriculum-python"]
Let's look at line 7:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,text]
----
fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8,1,1,5)
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
This means the sound clip called "RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8" will be added to track 1, starting at measure 1 and ending at measure 5.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Let's look at line 7:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,text]
----
fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8,1,1,5);
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
This means the sound clip called "RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8" will be added to track 1, starting at measure 1 and ending at measure 5.

[[ChangeEnd]]
=== Changing the End Time of a Clip

[role="curriculum-python"]
Let's change line 7 so the sound clip ends at measure 9 instead of 5. The line should now look like this:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,text]
----
fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE_MAINBEAT_8,1,1,9)
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
Use the code editor to change line 7. Then run the code, play the music, and listen to how it has changed.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
image::../media/HOC/hoc_change_end.PNG[]

[[ChangeStart]]
=== Changing the Start Time of a Clip

[role="curriculum-python"]
Now let's look at line 8. The line reads:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,text]
----
fitMedia(RD_POP_PADCHORD_2,2,1,9)
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
This means the sound clip called "RD_POP_PADCHORD_2" will be added to track 2, starting at measure 1 and ending at measure 9.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Change the line so the sound clip starts at measure 5 instead of 1. The line should now look like this:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,text]
----
fitMedia(RD_POP_PADCHORD_2,2,5,9)
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
Use the code editor to change line 8. Then run the code, play the music, and listen to how it has changed.

[role="curriculum-python"]
image::../media/HOC/hoc_change_start.PNG[]

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Now let's look at line 8. The line reads:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,text]
----
fitMedia(RD_POP_PADCHORD_2,2,1,9);
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
This means the sound clip called "RD_POP_PADCHORD_2" will be added to track 2, starting at measure 1 and ending at measure 9.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Change the line so the sound clip starts at measure 5 instead of 1. The line should now look like this:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,text]
----
fitMedia(RD_POP_PADCHORD_2,2,5,9);

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
image::../media/HOC/hoc_change_start.PNG[]

[[StartAndEnd]]
=== Experiment with Start and End Times

[role="curriculum-python"]
Now that you know how to change the start and end times of clips in EarSketch, you can customize the music.

[role="curriculum-python"]
On lines 7 and 8, try some different values for the start and end parameters. Then, run the code and listen to how the music changes.

[role="curriculum-python"]
You can use whole numbers (like 1, 5, or 27) or decimals (like 1.25, 5.5, or 27.75) for start and end times. Remember that the smallest number you can use for a measure or track is 1.

[[DrumFills]]
=== Drum Fills

[role="curriculum-python"]
Line 14 of the code uses the `makeBeat()` function. This function allows you to make custom rhythms.

[role="curriculum-python"]
The `makeBeat()` function takes in four input parameters:

[role="curriculum-python"]
* sound clip
* track number
* start measure
* beat string

[role="curriculum-python"]
Line 14 contains the code:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,text]
----
makeBeat(OS_SNARE03, 3, 4, fillA)
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
This means the beat will use the sound clip "OS_SNARE03", will be added to track 3 at measure 4, and use the beat string `fillA`.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Line 14 of the code uses the `makeBeat()` function. This function allows you to make custom rhythms.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
The `makeBeat()` function takes in four input parameters:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
* sound clip
* track number
* start measure
* beat string

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Line 14 contains the code:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,text]
----
makeBeat(OS_SNARE03, 3, 4, fillA);
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
This means the beat will use the sound clip "OS_SNARE03", will be added to track 3 at measure 4, and use the beat string `fillA`.

[[Vars]]
=== Variables

[role="curriculum-python"]
In this example, `fillA` is a variable. Variables hold data such as numbers or words to be used later in the code.

[role="curriculum-python"]
The `fillA` variable holds a string of characters, `"0---0-0-00--0000"`, which describes a rhythm for `makeBeat()`. Strings always begin and end with quotation marks. The code also defines the variables `fillB` and `fillC` as strings.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Let's edit line 14 to use one of the other variables. Choose either `fillB` or `fillC` to replace `fillA` in the code. Here is what line 14 will look like if you choose `fillC`:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,text]
----
makeBeat(OS_SNARE03, 3, 4, fillC)
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
Once you have chosen a new drum fill, run the code and listen to the result.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
In this example, `fillA` is a variable. Variables hold data such as numbers or words to be used later in the code.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
The `fillA` variable holds a string of characters, `"0---0-0-00--0000"`, which describes a rhythm for `makeBeat()`. Strings always begin and end with quotation marks. The code also defines the variables `fillB` and `fillC` as strings.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,text]
----
makeBeat(OS_SNARE03, 3, 4, fillC);
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Once you have chosen a new drum fill, run the code and listen to the result.

[[BeatStrings]]
=== Editing Beat Strings

[role="curriculum-python"]
EarSketch has a function called `reverseString()` which can reverse the order of the characters in a string.

[role="curriculum-python"]
On line 16 in the code, type the following:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,text]
----
fillRev = reverseString(fillA)
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
This creates a new variable called `fillRev` that contains a reversed version of `fillA`. Since `fillA` is `"0---0-0-00--0000"`, `fillRev` will be `"0000--00-0-0---0"`.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
EarSketch has a function called `reverseString()` which can reverse the order of the characters in a string.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
On line 16 in the code, type the following:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,text]
----
fillRev = reverseString(fillA);
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
This creates a new variable called `fillRev` that contains a reversed version of `fillA`. Since `fillA` is `"0---0-0-00--0000"`, `fillRev` will be `"0000--00-0-0---0"`.

[[NewFill]]
=== Making a New Fill

[role="curriculum-python"]
We can use `fillRev` in a `makeBeat()` function. Instead of editing the existing `makeBeat()` function, we will make a new one to add a second drum fill to the music.

[role="curriculum-python"]
On line 17, type the following code to put the reversed fill into your song:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,text]
----
makeBeat(OS_SNARE03, 3, 8, fillRev)
----

[role="curriculum-python"]
This means the beat will use the sound clip "OS_SNARE03", will be added to track 3 at measure 8, and will use the beat string stored in `fillRev`.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Run the code and listen to the result.

[role="curriculum-python"]
image::../media/HOC/hoc_new_fill.PNG[]

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
We can use `fillRev` in a `makeBeat()` function. Instead of editing the existing `makeBeat()` function, we will make a new one to add a second drum fill to the music.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
On line 17, type the following code to put the reversed fill into your song:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,text]
----
makeBeat(OS_SNARE03, 3, 8, fillRev);
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
This means the beat will use the sound clip "OS_SNARE03", will be added to track 3 at measure 8, and will use the beat string stored in `fillRev`.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Run the code and listen to the result.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
image::../media/HOC/hoc_new_fill.PNG[]

[[UserFill]]
=== Add Your Own Fill

[role="curriculum-python"]
Use what you've learned to write another `makeBeat()` call at a different measure with a different beat string.

[role="curriculum-python"]
You can use or modify one of the provided strings or try to write one from scratch using "0" and "-" characters. Beat strings are usually 16 characters long, which represents one measure of music.

[[Comments]]
=== Using Comments

[role="curriculum-python"]
Throughout the example code, you'll see section labels such as `# Add Sounds`, `# Fills`, and `# More Sounds`. The "#" symbol at the start of the line means that line is a comment. Comments provide information about the code but are ignored by the computer.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Comments can be used as labels and explanations to help make code easier to read. They can also be used to disable lines of code so they are ignored by the computer when the code is run.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Throughout the example code, you'll see section labels such as `// Add Sounds`, `// Fills`, and `// More Sounds`. The "//" symbol at the start of the line means that line is a comment. Comments provide information about the code but are ignored by the computer.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Comments can be used as labels and explanations to help make code easier to read. They can also be used to disable lines of code so they are ignored by the computer when the code is run.

[[AddSounds]]
=== Adding More Sounds

[role="curriculum-python"]
Under the `# More Sounds` comment, there is a series of `fitMedia()` functions that are commented out. Each contains a different sound.

[role="curriculum-python"]
You can enable them by deleting the "#" character at the beginning of the line.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Try uncommenting different combinations of lines. Then, run the code and listen to the result. See if you can guess what each line of code will add to the music before you press run.
