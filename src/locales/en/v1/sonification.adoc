AW 07/14/16: In the current version of ES, the importImage section is on pages 1, 2, and 3 of the curriculum. In this version, it is on the second page (after Multidimensional Lists/Arrays), which makes less sense. I'm moving it back to the first page, but please let me know where would you like the section to be: After Images as Data, or after Multidimensional Lists/Arrays. It makes more sense on the first page, but I wanted to double-check.

=== Images as Data

If you could hear this image of the Orion Nebula, what would it sound like?

[[orion]]
.Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/STScI
image::../media/OptionalLessons/orion-300x300.jpg[Alt Text]

It might seem strange to think about hearing a picture, but both music and images are just types of data in a computer. *Sonification* is a way to use audio to convey information, by turning data into sound.
Sonification has a lot of useful applications, like helping the visually impaired through sound. We can also use sonification to help us generate new musical materials that we might not otherwise think of.

Though you can sonify many different kinds of data, images are a fun place to start.

So, how can we get music from an image? A digital image is really just made up of a lot of small pieces of data – and sonification lets us turn data into sound. Think about what happens when you zoom in on a picture, looking at it closer and closer. Eventually, you get to the smallest single component of an image. If you zoom in far enough, any image is just a lot of little squares of different colors. These are called _pixels_. Pixels are the smallest part of an image, with a big group of them making up the whole.

[[zoomin]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/zoom-in.jpg[Alt Text]

The color of each of these pixels is a piece of data. You can learn more about visuals and how computers store them in chapters 26 to 28. For now all you need to know is the computer can look at an image and tell what color each pixel is, producing numbers that you can use in EarSketch programs.

//AW: here is where I've put the importImage section


[[multidimensionalData]]
=== Multidimensional Lists and Arrays

We now know that any image is made up of a large number of pixels, each of which has number values that represent colors and brightness. Consider this row of four (zoomed in) pixels:

[[gridtop]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/grid-top.jpg[Alt Text]

These pixels are grayscale, so they’re easily represented by one number each that tells us how light or dark they are. Luminosity is on a scale of 0 to 255, from black (0) to white (255). The values of these four pixels are: 255, 189, 80, 0.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Remember our list data structure that can store any kind of information? The values of this row of pixels could be easily stored in a list.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Remember our array data structure that can store any kind of information? The values of this row of pixels could be easily stored in an array.

[role="curriculum-python"]
`pixels = [255, 189, 80, 0]`

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
`var pixels = [255, 189, 80, 0]`

Most of the time, an image isn’t a single row of course. Instead, it’s 2-dimensional. Any image, zoomed in to its pixels, could look something like this:

[[gridgrays]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/grid_grays.jpg[Alt Text]

[role="curriculum-python"]
We now have a square image with four rows. You could think of this as four different lists:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
We now have a square image with four rows. You could think of this as four different arrays:

row1 = [255, 189, 80, 0] +
row2 = [255, 80, 189, 189] +
row3 = [189, 0, 189, 0] +
row4 = [0, 189, 189, 80]

[role="curriculum-python"]
As we learned, lists can store any data type… this includes lists! We can also represent our image as a list of lists, or a multidimensional list.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
As we learned, arrays can store any data type… this includes arrays! We can also represent our image as an array of arrays, or a multidimensional array.

matrixExample = [[255, 189, 80, 0], [255, 80, 189, 189], [189, 0, 189, 0], [0, 189, 189, 80]]
****

[role="curriculum-python"]
Notice how each list within the “matrix” list represents a single row of pixels. If we had the ability to step through that matrix and look at every value inside it, what could we do with those values? Using sonification, we can turn those numbers into sound.

Here’s a simpler example. What if our matrix was just black and white? This is a zoomed-in image of an 8×8 square – each square is a single pixel.

What do you think this image looks like as data? Remember that the luminosity value of a black pixel is 0 and a white pixel is 255.

[[importimage]]
=== importImage

After you’ve made a guess about the data, here’s a way for you to check it. If you want to work with images in EarSketch, you can use our *importImage* function that converts any image into data that can be used within EarSketch. `importImage` takes 3 required arguments (and one optional argument for color data). These are the 3 basic arguments:

`importImage(imageURL, numberOfRows, numberOfColumns)`

The image URL is the source of the image, so you will have to use a picture on the Internet. If you have your own image file you want to sonify, you can use any online storage service to upload it to the internet. To get the URL of an image online, try right-clicking it and choosing “Copy Image Location”.

The number of rows and columns refers to the size of the matrix that `importImage` will return. The function actually divides the picture up into a grid of size numberOfRows x numberOfColumns, and returns the average value of each grid space.

[role="curriculum-python"]
To convert the black-and-white grid image from above into a multidimensional list of pixels, right-click it to find and copy the image URL, and paste that in as your first argument. Choose 8 rows and 8 columns. It should look something like this:

setTempo(120);
var myImage = importImage("https://earsketch.gatech.edu/curriculum/curriculum/media/OptionalLessons/grid_zoomed.png", 8, 8);

Take a look at what gets printed to the console. Was the data for that image what you expected? It should look something like this:

----
[[0,255,0,255,0,255,0,255],
[255,0,255,0,255,0,255,0],

[role="curriculum-python"]
You can also specify any list dimensions for the output – you don’t have to just use the original number of pixels. Our image here is only 8×8 pixels, which is very small. Imagine how many pixels most images you look at are! When you’re working with images in EarSketch, you probably won’t want to work with hundreds or thousands or millions of pixels – so instead, `importImage` lets you turn any image into a multidimensional list of whatever size you want. If you can’t decide what size to use, choosing “16″ for columns might work well, since that’s the number of sixteenth notes in an EarSketch measure and the number of measures in many musical phrases. For now, put in “8″ and “8″ for the number of rows and columns, to match the data for our 8×8 grid.

Most of the time, you’ll just want your image to be in black and white (greyscale), unless you’re doing something in EarSketch specific to RGB color values. If you choose to use a color image, then you have the option to convert it to a 3D matrix. Since our grid is black and white, we don’t have to worry about that for now.

[[nestedloops]]
=== Nested Loops

Now that we know how to turn an image into data using `importImage`, we can use EarSketch to turn that data into sound. Let’s go back to our checkerboard. We can turn it into a drum beat by writing code that will create a beat with hits on the black squares and rests on the white squares.

[[gridzoomed]]
image::../media/OptionalLessons/grid_zoomed.png[Alt Text]

[role="curriculum-python"]
Remember from our lesson about Lists that we can access an element in a single-dimensional list like this: `list[index]`. For a two-dimensional list, we give coordinates: `list[index1][index2]`. So, for the example above, `myImage[0][0] = 0` and `myImage[0][1] = 255`. This represents the first two pixels in the first row.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]

[role="curriculum-python"]
When we learned about iterating through lists, we saw how easy it is to step through a one-dimensional list using a for loop. In order to step through a multidimensional list, we just need to use two for loops. We *nest* them together, so that an outer loop steps through each row, and an inner loop steps through each column for the current row.

Let’s step through this code line by line in order to understand it completely. First, line 1 defines a loop over the rows of the checkerboard image and defines the variable outerCounter to hold the value of the current row.

The length of the `myImage` list is simply the number of lists inside the 2-dimensional list, which is 8. We’ll call this the number of rows in the `myImage` list. So the outerCounter variable will run from 0 to 7, which is exactly what we want.

Line 2 does nearly the same thing but specifies a different range of values to loop over.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Notice the `len(myImage[0])`. This simply says the length of the `myImage[0]` list. We can see that `myImage[0]` is the first element in the list, which is the first list inside the `myImage` list:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Notice the `myImage[0].length`. This simply says the length of the `myImage[0]` array. We can see that `myImage[0]` is the first element in the outer array, which is the first array inside the `myImage` array:

The length of this list is 8. Thus, the `innerCounter` variable is defined as `range(8)`, which is 0 to 7. We can think of the inner loop as looping over each column in the current row of the `myImage` multidimensional list. The result is that `myImage[outerCounter][innerCounter]` will start at `myImage[0][0]`. At the end of the inner loop, the value of `innerCounter` will increase by one, and the index of the `myImage` list will change to `myImage[0][1]`. The inner loop will keep incrementing until it has reached the end of the first row, and then will finish and move again to the outer loop, which will increase the `outerCounter` value by one. Then the inner loop will start over again at the second row: `myImage[1][0]` and so on.

[role="curriculum-python"]
To summarize, the `outerCounter` starts at 0, then it goes to the inner loop, where the `innerCounter` increases from 0 to 7. When the inner loop is finished with the current row, the computer will go back to the outer loop, increasing `outerCounter` to 1, and then inner loop will start again with the updated value, increasing the `innerCounter` variable from 0 to 7 again, and so on. To see this process in the console, uncomment the `print` statements in the loop.

*Exercise:*

* Some of the best images to use for sonification are those with an alternating pattern that can be used, for example, to create a beat string. It just so happens that QR codes typically have alternating (black and white) pixels with exactly these patterns.
** Try creating your own QR codes using a free QR code generator.
** After generating your code, right-click to get the image's URL. Then use the URL in `importImage` to obtain a list to use in your sonification code.
