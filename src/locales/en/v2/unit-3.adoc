== Unit 3: Structure your Songs
:nofooter:

Now that you have many tools to create your song, add effects and mix your tracks, we will be looking at the song's structure. We'll be using custom functions for that: these are functions that you will create yourself!

We will also look at user inputs and how they can be embedded in your code to create personalize songs. Finally, we'll see how you can use data structures to simplify your code.
