== Getting Started with EarSketch
:nofooter:

In this chapter you will learn how EarSketch works. You will place sounds into your music and see how to debug your code.

=== Discover EarSketch
:nofooter:

In EarSketch, you will give the computer instructions by writing code. One line of code is one instruction. All the instructions together are called the program (these instructions can also be called an algorithm). Just like following a recipe in a cookbook can lead to cooked meal, executing a program in EarSketch can lead to a song. How does it work? Find out in the video below!

To use EarSketch

. You can browse and select sounds in your *sound browser*.
. You will write code in your *code editor* .
. When you click the *run* button, your music will be shown in the *Digital Audio Workstation* (or *DAW*).
. You can then click the *play* button to listen to your music.
. Then change your code until you are satisfied with what you hear!
. You can open and close this curriculum panel using the toggle button on the top of the panel.

_What is a DAW?_

A *Digital Audio Workstation*, or *DAW*, is a piece of software that produces or edits audio on a computer, be it in a professional studio or in home laptop-based studios.

Some popular DAWs include https://www.ableton.com/[Ableton Live^], https://www.image-line.com/[FL Studio^], https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/[Logic Pro^], http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/[GarageBand^], https://www.avid.com/pro-tools[Pro Tools^], and http://www.reaper.fm/[Reaper^].

EarSketch is DAW that allows you to create music by writing code.

Here is how to make full use of the DAW:

Let's try running a code example in EarSketch! On the box below, press the blue clipboard icon in the top right corner. This will paste the example code onto a new file in the *code editor*. No need to understand the code yet, just press the _run_ button and your music will show up in the DAW. You can press the _play_ button to hear it.

=== Create your first script!

Let's see how to create a script from scratch.

. *Create.* In the editor tabs, click the white "+" icon.
+
If this is your first script, click the large blue text "Click here to create a new script!"
+
[[newscriptplus]]
.Create a new script, open scripts
[caption="Figure 1.2.1: "]
image::../media/U1P1/NewScriptPlus.png[Alt Text]


. *Choose a name and language.* Give your new script a name, and choose between Python and JavaScript programming languages.

image::../media/U1P1/newScriptPromptJS.png[Alt Text]

. *(OPTIONAL) Sign in or create a new account.* To save your scripts for future editing and sharing, sign in with an EarSketch account.
+
_Note: Your EarSketch account does not require any personal information or email._

*_What is a programming language?_*

Code is written in a *programming language*. Like a spoken language it has vocabulary and syntax. You need to follow your programming language's grammar rules as you would with spoken language.

When you press the *run* button, a *compiler* translates the Python or JavaScript instructions into machine code which the computer can understand. Then the computer *executes* the code, which causes your music appear in the DAW.

At the deepest level, computers execute code using *binary*. This means that all computer code eventually becomes `1` 's and `0` 's as it is processed by electrical components in the computer.

[[fitmedia]]
=== The `fitMedia()` function

Now that you have created your first script, let's start working on your music!

Watch this video to see how to add an audio clip to your song:

[role="curriculum-python curriculum-mp4"]
[[video110py]]
video::./videoMedia/1_3_fitmedia_py.mp4[]

[role="curriculum-javascript curriculum-mp4"]
[[video110js]]
video::./videoMedia/1_3_fitmedia_js.mp4[]

To add a sound with `fitMedia()`, use the following form.

`fitMedia(sound, track, start, end)`

There are 4 *parameters*, separated by commas.

. *Sound*: the sound constant from the sound browser
. *Track*: the track number
. *Start*: the starting measure
. *End*: the ending measure

_Example:_

`fitMedia(Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_2, 2, 1, 5)`

The code above will place the sound `Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_2` on track `2` from measures `1` to `5`.

Try adding `fitMedia()` to a script.

When you've finished adding all your parameters, press _run_. You will see your sounds visualized in the DAW. Press _play_ to listen to your song.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Note: In JavaScript an optional semicolon `;` can be added to the end of each statement. Use of the semicolon is your personal choice.

////
OPTIONAL
////

{nbsp} +

*_The Sound Browser_*

The *sound browser* provides a library of over four thousand sounds to use in your music.
Contributors include celebrity musicians

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara[Ciara^],

and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Guru[Young Guru^].

You can explore the sound browser within the *Content Manager* (left) by clicking "sounds". Try using different sound constants inside `fitMedia()`.

Note: The https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/license[EarSketch License Agreement^] covers fair use of stock sounds.

.PRACTICE
****
Using sounds that you like:

. Place sounds on 2 different tracks 
. Place sounds from measures 2 to 12
. Create a short song with 3 tracks that is 8 measures long or more

For each exercise, you can have your neighbour listen to your song.

If you have errors when running your code, check out the next chapter about debugging.
****


[[debugging]]
=== Debug your code

Sometimes programmers make mistakes that cause code to work incorrectly, or not run at all. In programming, coding faults are called *errors*, or *bugs*. The process of finding and fixing bugs is called *debugging*. You can use debugging strategies, using the console.

What are the different types of errors?

. *Syntax errors*: Your program does not run because your code breaks the language's *syntax* rules (ex: you forgot to close a parenthesis, or you wrote fitMedia incorrectly).
. *Runtime errors*: Your program starts to run but halts due to an error.
. *Logic errors*: Your program runs, but it doesn't do what is expected. You can fix these by looking at the DAW to check if the clips you meant to add were actually added in the right place. 

////
END OF OPTIONAL
////


Here are some common errors:

[role="curriculum-python"]
. *Misspelling:* Check the spelling when using a function like `fitMedia()` or sound constants.
. *Case sensitivity:* Most words used in programming are case-sensitive (the computer recognizes the difference between capitalized and uncapitalized letters). Pay attention to lowercase and uppercase letters. For example, write `fitMedia()` and not `FitMedia()` or `fitmedia()`. Most items in a script follow a rule called *camel-caps*: the first word is lower case, and the first letter of subsequent words are capitalized, as in `exampleFunctionName()`.
. *Parentheses:* Forgetting an opening or closing parenthesis where needed will cause a <</en/v1/every-error-explained-in-detail#syntaxerror,syntax error>>.
. *Script setup:* EarSketch adds some code to a new script automatically, but you might accidentally delete `from earsketch import *`.
. *Punctuation:* Missing commas or other punctuation errors

Here is the answer

. The `setTempo()` function is missing a parentheses
. The first `fitMedia()` is missing an 'e'
. The first `fitMedia()` is missing a comma between the third and fourth parameters
. The second `fitMedia()` is missing an uppercase 'M'
. In the second `fitMedia()`, the order of parameters is not correct: it should be sound clip name then track number
