== Get Started with EarSketch
:nofooter:

In this chapter you will learn how EarSketch works, you will place sounds (clips) into your music and see how to debug your code.

=== Discover EarSketch
:nofooter:

In EarSketch, you will give the computer instructions by writing code. One line of code is one instruction. All the instructions together are called the program (these instructions can also be called an algorithm). Just like following a recipe in a cookbook can lead to cooked meal, executing a program in EarSketch can lead to a song. Where in the program does the code go? Find out in the video below!

To use EarSketch

. You can browse and select sounds in your *sound browser*.
. You will write code in your *code editor* .
. When you click the *run* button, your music will be shown in the *Digital Audio Workstation* (or *DAW*).
. You can then click the *play* button to listen to your music.
. Then change your code until you are satisfied with what you hear!
. You can open and close this curriculum panel using the toggle button on the top of the panel.

_What is a DAW?_

A *Digital Audio Workstation*, or *DAW*, is a piece of software that produces or edits audio or sound clips on a computer, be it in a professional studio or in home laptop-based studios.

Some popular DAWs include https://www.ableton.com/[Ableton^], https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/[Logic Pro^], http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/[GarageBand^], and http://www.reaper.fm/[Reaper^].

With a DAW, you can record, edit, visualize and play audio files. These audio files are called *clips*.

EarSketch is just like a DAW, except you get to directly program the musical elements using code.

Here is how to make full use of the DAW:

Let's try running a code example in EarSketch! On the box below, press the blue clipboard icon in the top right corner. This will paste the example code onto a new file in the *code editor*. No need to understand the code yet, just press the _run_ button and your music will show up in the DAW. You can press the _play_ button to hear it.

[[createanewscript]]
=== Create your first script!

In EarSketch, each script that you write will correspond to one song. Let's see how to create a script:

. *Sign in or create a new account* in the top right corner of your screen. If you click the white button that reads "Create / Reset Account", you can either recover a lost password, or create a new account ("Register a New Account"). _Caution:_ in general on the internet, don't use the same password for all your accounts & never share your passwords.

. *Click to create.* If you don't have any scripts open, click on the large blue link in the code editor that states "Click here to create a new script!"
+
If you have one or more scripts open already, then click on the white "+" icon next to the right most tab.
+
[[newscriptplus]]
.Create a new script, open scripts
[caption="Figure 1.2.1: "]

*_What is a programming language?_*

Code is written in a *programming language*, which includes vocabulary and a syntax, just like a regular language. You need to know the grammar rules of your programming language or the computer won't be able to execute your instructions. 

In EarSketch, you can code in either Python or JavaScript.

[role="curriculum-python"]
_You are in Python mode. Python is used by companies like Google, Yahoo, NASA, Disney and to code games like Civilization 4, Battlefield 2 and Crystal Space._

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
_You are in JavaScript mode. JavaScript is one of the ten most popular programming languages in the world. Almost every website uses JavaScript._

At the deepest level, computers operate in combinations of 1s and 0s: binary numbers. That's because the electronic components can react differently if there is electric current (1) or if there is no electric current (0). When you press the *run* button, the computer translates the Python or JavaScript instructions into binary code. The code is then *executed* by the computer, and you can see your music appear in the DAW.

[[fitmedia]]
=== The `fitMedia()` function

Now that you have created your first script, let's start working on your music!

Watch this video to see how to add an audio clip to your song:

[role="curriculum-python curriculum-mp4"]
[[video110py]]
video::./videoMedia/1_3_fitmedia_py.mp4[]

[role="curriculum-javascript curriculum-mp4"]
[[video110js]]
video::./videoMedia/1_3_fitmedia_js.mp4[]

To add a sound clip to the DAW, we start by typing `fitMedia()`. Between the parenthesis, we'll have 4 parameters, separated by commas:

. *A clip name*: place your cursor between the parenthesis, go to the sound browser, select a clip, and paste it using the blue paste icon.
. *The track number*: tracks are the rows that run across the DAW; they help you organize your sounds by instrument-type (vocals, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass, drums, etc.). You can start at track one for your first sound.
. *Start measure*: the measure when your sound will start playing. Measures are musical time units. One measure is 4 beats. You can start at measure one with your first sound.
. *End measure*: the measure when your sound will stop playing.

_Example:_ `fitMedia(Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_2, 1, 1, 5)` will place the sound `Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_2` on track 1 from measure 1 to measure 5.

Then, press _run_: you should visualize your sound in the DAW. When you press _play_ you can hear it.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
A *statement* tells the computer to carry out an action. For example, `fitMedia(Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_1, 1, 1, 5);` is a statement. Every statement in JavaScript *_should end with a semicolon_*.


////
OPTIONAL
////

The *Sound Browser*: Browse or search 4,000 audio clips to use in your music, made by musicians/producers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Guru[Young Guru^], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Devine[Richard Devine^], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciara[Ciara^], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(rapper)[Common^], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharrell_Williams[Pharrell Williams^], Irizarry y Caraballo, and https://www.sndbrd.com/[Milknsizz^].

See some examples of code using `fitMedia()` (Remember you can click the blue clip board in the top right corner of the box to paste the code into a new file):

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
# Using fitMedia(): Adding a clip to the DAW

# Setup
from earsketch import *
setTempo(120)

# Music
fitMedia(Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_2, 1, 1, 5)

----
// Using fitMedia(): Adding a clip to the DAW

// Setup
setTempo(120);

// Music
fitMedia(Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_2, 1, 1, 5);
----

For an extra challenge, add more `fitMedia()` calls to your script like we do below. Notice that we use a different track number for each `fitMedia()` call:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
# Using fitMedia() 2: Multiple fitMedia() calls on different tracks

# Setup Section
from earsketch import *
setTempo(100)

# Music Section
fitMedia(Y01_DRUMS_1, 1, 1, 9)
fitMedia(Y11_BASS_1, 2, 1, 9)
fitMedia(Y11_GUITAR_1, 3, 1, 9)
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]

// Using fitMedia() 2: Multiple fitMedia() calls on different tracks

// Setup Section

// Music Section
fitMedia(Y01_DRUMS_1, 1, 1, 9);
fitMedia(Y11_BASS_1, 2, 1, 9);
fitMedia(Y11_GUITAR_1, 3, 1, 9);
----

.PRACTICE
****
Using sounds that you like:

. Place sounds on 2 different tracks 
. Place sounds from measures 2 to 12
. Create a short song with 3 tracks that is 8 measures long or more

For each exercise, you can have your neighbour listen to your song.

If you have errors when running your code, check out the next chapter about debugging.

[[debugging]]
=== Debug your code

Sometimes programmers make mistakes that cause code to work incorrectly, or not run at all. In programming, coding faults are called *errors*, or *bugs*. The process of finding and fixing bugs is called *debugging*. You can use debugging strategies, using the console.

What are the different types of errors?

. *Syntax errors*: Your program does not run because your code breaks the language's *syntax* rules (ex: you forgot to close a parenthesis, or you wrote fitMedia incorrectly).
. *Runtime errors*: Your program starts to run but halts due to an error.
. *Logic errors*: Your program runs, but it doesn't do what is expected. You can fix these by looking at the DAW to check if the clips you meant to add were actually added in the right place. 

////
END OF OPTIONAL

Here are some common errors:

[role="curriculum-python"]
. *Misspelling:* Check the spelling when using a function like `fitMedia()` or sound constants.
. *Case sensitivity:* Most words used in programming are case-sensitive (the computer recognizes the difference between capitalized and uncapitalized letters). Pay attention to lowercase and uppercase letters. For example, write `fitMedia()` and not `FitMedia()` or `fitmedia()`. Most items in a script follow a rule called *camel-caps*: the first word is lower case, and the first letter of subsequent words are capitalized, as in `exampleFunctionName()`.
. *Parentheses:* Forgetting an opening or closing parenthesis where needed will cause a <</en/v1/every-error-explained-in-detail#syntaxerror,syntax error>>.
. *Script setup:* EarSketch adds some code to a new script automatically, but you might accidentally delete `from earsketch import *`.
. *Punctuation:* Missing commas or other punctuation errors

Time to practice!
Find the 5 errors in the following code:

[source,python]
----
# Finding errors: Five errors below must be fixed

from earsketch import *
setTempo(88

fitMdia(HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVEPART_001, 1, 1 9)
fitmedia(2, HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVEPART_003, 1, 9)

fitmedia(2, HIPHOP_DUSTYGROOVEPART_001, 1, 9);
----
////
OPTIONAL
////

Here is the answer

. The `setTempo()` function is missing a parentheses
. The first `fitMedia()` is missing an 'e'
. The first `fitMedia()` is missing a comma between the third and fourth parameters
. The second `fitMedia()` is missing an uppercase 'M'
. In the second `fitMedia()`, the order of parameters is not correct: it should be sound clip name then track number
