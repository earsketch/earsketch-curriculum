== Custom Functions and Song Structure
:nofooter:

The song structure is the song's organization over time. The goal is to create meaningful sections and transitions for the flow of your music. In this chapter, you'll create your own function, custom functions, to structure your songs!

[[asongsstructure]]
=== A song's structure
:nofooter:

A song can be divided into *sections*. A section is made up of several measures (musical time units), and it expresses an idea or feeling. Usually, musicians try to add contrast between different sections. _Intro, Verse, Chorus_, and _Outro_ are examples of sections.

A common and simple *form*, or song structure, is ABA. A and B are two different sections, for example chorus and verse. The B section adds variety, while returning to the A section invokes familiarity. The code below creates an ABA form. Section B features contrasting sounds to Section A - a slower and louder bass, and an additional rattling:

.PRACTICE
****
Select a song that you like. Listen to it and try to notice the different sections. Can you tell when the musicians change sections? How many times do you hear the chorus and verse? What kind of contrasts can you observe? Share your example with your neighbor.
****

Keep in mind that a musical phrase sounds most natural when clips are arranged into groups of two, four, eight, sixteen, etc. So your sections should preferably have a size of two, four, eight, sixteen measures.

[[creatingyourcustomfunctions]]
=== Create your custom functions

In the previous example with the ABA song, the code is large, and the code is repeated for the second A section. There is a way to be more concise, thanks to *custom functions*! We will define a function that will represent section A, then call the function twice.

The difference with functions that you have used like `fitMedia()`, is that `fitMedia()` is already pre-defined by our team to play a sound. In a custom function, you get to define exactly what it does. Here is how you would define section A:

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]

include::code-examples/custom-functions-untitled1.js.txt[]
----

. `sectionA()` is the name we chose for our function. You can choose any name you like. Try to name your function in a descriptive way so your code is easier to read.
. The instructions are the *body* of the function. They are indented.

.PRACTICE
****
Paste this code in a new script, and run it. You should see that your DAW remains empty. 
That's because you need to *call* a function to use it.  
To call your function, add the line `sectionA()`, unindented, after your function definition. When running the code, you should see section A in your DAW
****

Now we want to add section A from measures nine to thirteen. However, when we call `sectionA()`, the sounds are placed from measures one to five. To remedy this issue, we will create *parameters* for our function.

.PRACTICE
****
In your current script you created for the previous practice problem:

2. In the function's body, replace the start measures (1) and end measures (5) by `startMeasure` and `endMeasure` respectively.
1. Add the parameters `startMeasure` and `endMeasure` separated by a comma between the parentheses of the sectionA function in its definition like this: `sectionA(startMeasure,endMeasure)`.
3. When you call your function, add the parameters `1` and `5` between the parentheses. Run the code to make sure there is no error.
4. Add a second function call, this time with the parameters `9` and `13`. Run the code to make sure there is no error.
5. Define a function for section B, using the same process, and call section B from measures 5 to 9 and from measures 13 to 17.

Here is what your code could look like:

[[transitionstrategies]]
=== Transition Strategies

Now that you know how to create custom functions to structure your song, let's look at transitions. *Transitions* help one section smoothly go into the next. They can connect verse and chorus, build up to a drop, mix between tracks (DJing), or change keys. The goal of a transition is to grab the listener's attention and let them know a change is about to occur. 

Following are some popular strategies for creating musical transitions:

. *Crash Cymbal*: Placing a crash cymbal on the first beat of a new section. See this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RssWT0Wem2w&t=0m55s[example^].
. *Drum Fill*: A rhythmic variation to fill the gap before a new section. See these https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMskGG39Y0Y[examples^] of drum fills.
. *Track Dropouts*: Making some tracks temporarily drop out to create pauses. Listen to https://youtu.be/cQbAm4dIDKA?t=82[Imagine Dragon's Love^].
. *Melody Variation*: Introducing a variation of the chords, bass line, or melody before the new section. Often, a folder within the EarSketch sound library contains variations of a similar riff.
. *Riser*: A note or noise that increases in pitch. It is very common in EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and creates an anticipation of a drop. You can use the search term "riser" in the Sound Browser. A reversed crash cymbal can be used as a riser, like YG_EDM_REVERSE_CRASH_1. Here is an example of a riser in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KGsAozrCnA&t=31m30s[a techno set from Carl Cox^].
. *Snare Roll*: A sequence of repeated snare hits, with increasing density, pitch, or amplitude. You can use a clip like RD_FUTURE_DUBSTEP_FILL_1 or HOUSE_BREAK_FILL_003, or with `makeBeat()`. Here is an https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3HLuTAsbFE[example^].
. *Looping*: Repeating a short segment of melody before a new section. Here is an https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQg4wnbBjiQ[example^] of looping in DJ'ing.
. *Crossfading*: Decreasing the volume of one section while increasing the volume of a new section. 
. *Anacrusis*: When the melody of the new section starts a couple beats early.

.PRACTICE
****
Looking at this list of possible transitions, select 2 of them and try to see how you could implement them using code. You can work in pairs. Once you've thought about it, you can have a look at the examples below.

The transition should be placed 1 or 2 measures before the new section. You can use several transition techniques at the same time.
****
 

Drum fills:

The track dropout technique only requires the modification of a couple `fitMedia()` calls. An example is shown below.

The next example uses multiple risers and a crash cymbal during the transition.

[[yourfullsong]]
=== Your full song

In programming we can create *abstractions*, bundling of ideas to form a single concept. In music, we group musical ideas into sections. Functions are one kind of abstraction used in computer science. They pack multiple statements into one tool so they can be easily referred to. Abstractions can make the form of a program clearer.

.PRACTICE
****
Let's create a full song using all the tools you've discovered in EarSketch! Here is a suggestion of how to work, but you can adapt it as you like:

. Choose a theme for your song. Think about the type of sounds, instruments, or lyrics that will best convey your message.
. Then select a simple structure. 
. And finally, start coding! Start with some `fitMedia()` functions to select sounds.
. Use `makeBeat()` to add some percussion.
. You can upload your own sounds.
. Use `for` loops to reduce repetition in your code.
. Use custom functions to define your sections and create your song structure.
. Add one or two meaningful transitions.
. Add effects with setEffect().
. Add one or several conditional statements.
. Make sure you use variables to store some information such as sound clip names.
. Make sure you use comments to explain what you are doing.
. Don't forget to regularly run your code and listen to your song. This will help you modify it until you like the sound of it.
. Choose a name for your song.

In this example, we have used a for loop inside a custom function! We have used parameters of the function (`start` and `end`) inside the for loop.

=== Chapter 7 Summary

* *Sections* are related musical units consisting of multiple measures. Each expresses an idea or feeling.
* *Transitions* are passages of music used to connect consecutive musical sections.
* The structure and variety found within a song is known as its *form*. A common musical form is A-B-A.
* *Custom functions* are unique functions written by the programmer to accomplish a specific task. You have to create a custom function to be able to call it. You can create as many parameters as you want.
* An *abstraction* is the bundling of ideas to form a single, often less complex, concept. Functions are an example of abstraction.
