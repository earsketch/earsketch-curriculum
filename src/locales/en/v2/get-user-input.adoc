== Get User Input
:nofooter:

In this chapter, you will learn how to ask for input from users and adapt your music accordingly. For that, we'll look at return statements and the `readInput()` function.

[[returnstatement]]
=== Return Statement

* In addition to taking inputs (parameters), functions can output a value. In programming, we call this returning a value.
* The *return statement* is a statement inside the function body that: A. tells a function to return a value when called. B. signals the function to stop. If you have any statements after the `return` keyword, they will be ignored.
* To use the value that is returned by the function, create a variable and assign it the function call.
* A return statement is not compulsory. Without a return statement a function does not output a value. `fitMedia()` and `setEffect()` are examples of functions that don't return anything.

Here is a code example:

With the return statement, the complete control flow for a function looks like this:

.PRACTICE
****
Create a function that will implement a musical section with:

* Only one parameter, called `start`, which represents the start measure.
* One `return` statement that returns the end measure.
* A body function with `fitMedia()` functions.

Your section can last as many measures as you like.
Then call the function, and print the end measure.

Here is an example:

.PRACTICE
****
Let's say you have a section A, but you want it to vary slightly when it's called at different moments of the song. You will create a function called `sectionA()` with two `fitMedia()` calls.

The function should take two parameters: `start` and a boolean parameter `variation` that will allow the user to choose a variation when calling the function.

In the function body, you should have a conditional statement which will evaluate the parameter. Depending on the parameter value, you will change the sound used in one of your `fitMedia()` calls.

Then call the function at different measures with different variations.

[[userinput]]
=== Get User Input

We'll see how to ask for user input when the "run" button is pressed. This is possible thanks to the `readInput()` function. This function takes as a parameter a string (like "what tempo would you like for your music?"). When the user runs the code, they will see a new window with the string and are prompted to write an answer. The `readInput()` function returns what the user types there.

For example, copy the following code in a new script, and run it:

[role="curriculum-python"]
[source,python]
----
include::code-examples/get-user-input-untitled1.py.txt[]
----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
include::code-examples/get-user-input-untitled1.js.txt[]
----

We might need to convert the returned user input into a different data type. Here are useful functions:

[role="curriculum-python"]
* `str()` - converts any value into a string.
* `int()` - converts a string containing digits into an integer (for example: `"3"` becomes `3`).
* `float()` - convert a string containing digits with a decimal point into a float (for example: `"3.5"` becomes `3.5`).

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
* `String()` - converts any value into a string. Note that, for once, it's a function name that starts with an uppercase letter.
* `Number()` - converts a string into a number (for example: `"3.5"` becomes `3.5`).

In the example below, console input is used to determine the tempo of the song. We make sure to convert user input into an integer.

Here is another example of what you can do with user input. 

*Concatenation* is a means to link strings together, using the `+` symbol.  For example, concatenating the strings `"Hello"` and `"World"` yields `"HelloWorld"`. In the following example, the user is prompted to specify a clip number. The number is concatenated with `DUBSTEP_BASS_WOBBLE_0` to form a complete clip name like `DUBSTEP_BASS_WOBBLE_010`.

Ask for a user input to modify something in your song.

Here are ideas of tools you can use:

. string concatenation, 
. data conversion, 
. creating a specific parameter in a custom function

[[booleanlogic]]
=== Boolean Logic

We will now combine boolean logic and user input for another example of user interaction.

[role="curriculum-python"]
Let's first look at boolean logic. You know that *comparison operators* help create a boolean. For example, the operator `==` checks if two values are equal, and if so the boolean is set to `True`.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Let's first look at boolean logic. You know that *comparison operators* help create a boolean. For example, the operator `===` checks if two values are equal, and if so the boolean is set to `true`.

Now let's look at *boolean operators*: these help combine several booleans. There are three boolean operators:

[role="curriculum-python"]
* `and`: takes two boolean inputs and returns `True` only when both inputs are `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
* `or`: takes two boolean inputs and returns `True` when at least one input is `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
* `not`: takes one boolean input and returns the opposite (negated) boolean.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
* `&&`: is called "and"; it takes two boolean inputs and returns `true` only when both inputs are `true`, otherwise returns `false`.
* `||`: is called "or"; it takes two boolean inputs and returns `true` when at least one input is `true`, otherwise returns `false`.
* `!`: is called "not"; it takes one boolean input and returns the opposite (negated) boolean.

For example if you are sixteen, the sentence "I'm sixteen" is true and the sentence "I'm seventeen" is false. "I'm sixteen and I'm seventeen" (true and false) is false because you are not both sixteen and seventeen. But the sentence "I'm sixteen or I'm seventeen" (true or false) is true.

[role="curriculum-python"]
.PRACTICE
****
What do you think the following expressions evaluate to? `True` or `False`?

* `not True`
* `True and False`
* `True or False`
* `True and True`
* `(True and False) or True`
* `True and not False`
* `not (False or False)`
****

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
.PRACTICE
****
What do you think the following expressions evaluate to? `true` or `false`?

* `!true`
* `true && false`
* `true || false`
* `true && true`
* `(true && false) || true`
* `true && !false`
* `!(false || false)`
****

Here is a reminder of boolean creation, and some examples of boolean operations:

.PRACTICE
****
Now we will combine user input and boolean operations.

Write a script that will ask for the user to choose a genre, with a limited number of options (for example "hip hop" and "classical"). Depending on the user's answer, select a beat string that is works well with the genre. You can accept several possibilities. For example, "HIP HOP", "hip hop" and "Hip Hop" will output the same song.

.CHALLENGE
****
This is the Jukebox challenge: write a script that will ask for user input in terms of genre, with three options (for example "latino", "trap" and "dubstep"). Depending on the user's answer, create a song that goes with the genre.

=== Chapter 8 Summary

[role="curriculum-python"]
* *Return statements* can be included in a function definition to output a result when the function is called.
* `readInput()` will request a user input when you run your code. The only parameter is a string that the user will see. You can then use what the user has typed in your code, for example, to change the tempo or the genre of your music.
* Some functions allow you to convert data from one type to another. `str()` converts any value into a string.
`int()` converts a string containing digits into an integer. `float()` converts a string containing digits with a decimal point into a float.
* You can *concatenate* (link) strings together: "Hello"+"World" will evaluate to "HelloWorld".
* *Boolean logic* includes boolean operations. Here are boolean operators:
** `and`: takes 2 boolean inputs and returns `True` only when both inputs are `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
** `or`: takes 2 boolean inputs and returns `True` when at least 1 input is `True`, otherwise returns `False`.
** `not`: takes 1 boolean input and returns the opposite (negated) boolean.
* You now have many tools to introduce variations in your music: user input can determine elements. You can add a parameter in your custom functions to select a variation when you call your function.
