== Effects and Envelopes

:nofooter:

EarSketch lets the composer alter existing sounds to produce new and unique sounds. This is achieved through the `setEffect()` function, the focus of this chapter.

=== Use Effects in EarSketch

:nofooter:

*Effects* allow us to change qualities of sounds. Similar to how adding a filter alters a photo, adding an audio effect changes the sound. For example, you can change the volume, add some echo or reverb, etc.

We use the function `setEffect()`, which takes four arguments, similar to `fitMedia()`:

. *track*: Track number or `MIX_TRACK`
. *type*: Effect constant, like `DELAY`
. *parameter*: Parameter constant, like `DELAY_TIME`
. *value*: Parameter value, like `200`. This value must be within the effect's range.

.PRACTICE
****
Write a new song with two tracks and modify the volume for both of the tracks using the `setEffect()` function.
In that case, the effect name (second argument) is `VOLUME`, and the effect parameter (third argument) is `GAIN`. The effect value (fourth argument) is a number of decibels (dB), between `-60` and `+12`.
****

Here is an example below:

----

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
[source,javascript]
----
include::code-examples/effects-and-envelopes-volume-effect.js.txt[]
----

We've seen the `VOLUME` effect. Let's now look at `DELAY`. Listen to the 2 clips below, one without and one with a *delay* effect applied.

No effect:

++++
<div class="curriculum-mp3">audioMedia/reference.mp3</div>
++++

Delay effect:

++++
<div class="curriculum-mp3">audioMedia/delay2.mp3</div>
++++

In that case, the effect name (second argument) is `DELAY`, and the effect parameter (third argument) can either be `DELAY_TIME` (how long before the echo "answers") or `DELAY_FEEDBACK` (how loud your echo is). The value of `DELAY_TIME` is in milliseconds (1000 milliseconds is one second) and the value of `DELAY_FEEDBACK` is a number between `-120` and `-1`.

For example, `setEffect(1, DELAY, DELAY_TIME, 500)` puts a delay onto track 1 with the delay/echo lasting for 500 ms.

.PRACTICE
****
. Read about the delay effect in the list of effects chapter here: <</en/v1/every-effect-explained-in-detail#,effects>>
. Then run the code below and listen to the music without effects
. Then uncomment the first `setEffect()` line and listen to the difference
. Then uncomment the second `setEffect()` line and listen to the difference ("uncomment" means to erase the comment syntax, `#` or `//` from a block of code)
Note that the delay time, 500ms, is the length of one beat. Since the tempo is 120 beats per minute, there is one beat every 60/120 = 1/2 seconds. 1 second is 1000ms, so 1/2 second is 1000/2 = 500ms.
You can try modifying the delay time and observing if your music sounds better or not.

=== Functions and more effects

So far, you've been using several functions in EarSketch like `fitMedia()` or `setEffect()`. Note that the function names always start with a lower-case letter, and are often a verb. The parentheses tell the computer to *call*, or *execute*, the function. *Arguments*, or parameters, between the parentheses are separated by commas.

[role="curriculum-python"]
* `setTempo()`, `fitMedia()`, `makeBeat()`, and now `setEffect()` take arguments. They are part of the EarSketch *Application Programming Interface*, or *API*. EarSketch, or the EarSketch API, adds musical features to Python. Another example of API is the Google Maps API: a set of tools for embedding maps into websites or apps.
* In a later chapter, you'll also learn how to create your own custom functions.

* `setTempo()`, `fitMedia()`, `makeBeat()`, and now `setEffect()` take arguments. They are part of the EarSketch *Application Programming Interface*, or *API*. EarSketch, or the EarSketch API, adds musical features to JavaScript. Another example of API is the Google Maps API: a set of tools for embedding maps into websites or apps.
* In a later chapter, you'll also learn how to create your own custom functions.

The arguments of the function can each have a specific data type. The order of the arguments is important. Here are some data type examples:

* *Numbers*
** *Integers* are whole numbers, like 0, 5, or -26. Example: track numbers
** *Floating point* numbers are rational numbers like 0.125 or -21.0. Example: volume of -4.2dB
* *Strings* represent text. Example: `"0000----0000----"`

Now, let's play more with the `setEffect()` function. The following video shows how to use some effects:

*Reverb* (short for reverberation) is sound bouncing off walls and returning to your ears. It gives a sense of space to your sound. Think about the difference between talking in a small bedroom and talking in a large church. The larger and "flatter" the room, the longer it takes the waves to return to your ears, hence that "large echoey room" sound. The `REVERB` effect has parameters to control the decay time (`REVERB_DECAY`) and amount of the effect present (`MIX`).

Listen to the clips below to hear the result of adding reverb to a track:

No effect:

++++
<div class="curriculum-mp3">audioMedia/reverbReference.mp3</div>
++++

Reverb effect:

++++
<div class="curriculum-mp3">audioMedia/reverbEffect.mp3</div>
++++

{nbsp} +

.PRACTICE
****
Go to <</en/v1/every-effect-explained-in-detail#,this chapter>> for a complete list of effects.
Create a song with a volume effect and two other effects. Don't forget to write what you are doing in the comments and to create variables when necessary.

[[effectsandenvelopes2]]
=== Effects and Envelopes

You've started using effects, and maybe you'd like for one effect to change over time. For example, you might want a fade in (volume getting higher) at the beginning of your song.

*Envelopes* allow us to define how an effect changes over time.

We will use two value-time pairs. Each pair contains an effect value and a corresponding measure. For example, `(-60, 1, 0, 3)` means a point is placed at value `-60` at measure `1`, and another point is placed at value `0` at measure `3`. The envelope creates a line between these points, called a *ramp*:

[[envelopepoints]]
.An annotated envelope in EarSketch
[caption="Figure 5.3.1: "]
image::../media/U2/NewEnvelope.png[Alt Text]

To change an envelope, you just need the `setEffect()` function with seven arguments (the last four arguments are the two value-time pairs):

. track
. type
. parameter
. startValue
. start
. endValue
. end

The last three out of seven parameters are *optional parameters*. If left unspecified, as was the case when we used `setEffect()` with only four parameters, the effect is applied to the entire track.

Here is an example of fade in:

.PRACTICE
****
Create a new song. Use one `for` loop to add an envelope to all the tracks (for example: fade in and fade out for all your tracks), or to repeat an effect on the same track. You can use any effect you like.
Have your neighbor listen to your song, with and without the effect (to hear your song without the effect, comment out the lines that create the effect). Your neighbor has to guess which effect you added.
****

Below is an example of the above practice. Each iteration of the loop adds a one measure long segment of the envelope. Automating the GAIN parameter creates rhythmic volume fades. Try toggling the effect bypass in the DAW to hear the difference the effect makes (the "bypass" button to the left of the effect track in your DAW).

[[chapter5summary]]
=== Chapter 5 Summary

* *Effects* change the qualities of a sound to make them unique.
* *Volume* is related to loudness. *Delay* creates an echo. *Reverb* makes it feel like the sound is played in a large room. *Panning* places your music on the left or right side.
* Effects are implemented in EarSketch with the `setEffect()` function. Its syntax is `setEffect(track, type, parameter, value)`.
. *track*: Track number or `MIX_TRACK`
. *type*: Effect constant, like `DELAY`
. *parameter*: Parameter constant, like `DELAY_TIME`
. *value*: Parameter value, like `200`. This value must be within the effect's range.
* *Functions* contain instructions for the computer to execute. Data is sent to functions by *arguments*, which affect how the function executes. The syntax of a function *call* with two arguments is `myFunction(argument1, argument2)`. An example of syntax used in a function *call* with 4 arguments is `makeBeat(kick, 2, measure, kickBeat)`.
* A complete list of EarSketch effects and their parameters can be found in <</en/v1/every-effect-explained-in-detail#,effects>>, along with descriptions for each.
* *Envelopes* define how an effect parameter changes over time. They are described with value-time pairs, like _(value, time, value, time)_.
* For an envelope, the 7-parameter `setEffect()` arguments are: `setEffect(track, type, parameter, startValue, start, endValue, end)`.
