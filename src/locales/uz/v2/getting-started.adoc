== Getting Started with EarSketch

:nofooter:

In this chapter you will learn how EarSketch works. You will place sounds into your music and see how to debug your code.

=== Discover EarSketch

:nofooter:

In EarSketch, you will give the computer instructions by writing code. One line of code is one instruction. All the instructions together are called the program (these instructions can also be called an algorithm). Just like following a recipe in a cookbook can lead to cooked meal, executing a program in EarSketch can lead to a song. How does it work? Find out in the video below!

_RAIS nima?_

A *DAW*, or *Digital Audio Workstation*, is software that produces or edits audio on a computer, be it in a professional studio or in home laptop-based studios.

Some popular DAWs include https://www.ableton.com/[Ableton Live^], https://www.image-line.com/[FL Studio^], https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/[Logic Pro^], http://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/[GarageBand^], https://www.avid.com/pro-tools[Pro Tools^], and http://www.reaper.fm/[Reaper^].

EarSketch is DAW that allows you to create music by writing code.

Here is how to make full use of the DAW:

Keling, EarSketch-da kod misolini ishga tushirishga harakat qilaylik! On the box below, press the blue clipboard icon in the top right corner. Bu misol kodini *kod muharriri*dagi yangi faylga joylashtiradi. Hali kodni tushunishning hojati yo'q, shunchaki _Ishga Tushir_ tugmasini bosing va musiqangiz RAIS da paydo bo'ladi. Uni tinglash uchun _ijro_ tugmasini bosishingiz mumkin.

=== Create your first script!

Let's see how to create a script from scratch.

. *Create.* In the editor tabs, click the white "+" icon.

If this is your first script, click the large blue text "Click here to create a new script!"

_Note: Your EarSketch account does not require any personal information or email._

*_Dasturlash tili nima?_*

Code is written in a *programming language*. Like a spoken language it has vocabulary and syntax. You need to follow your programming language's grammar rules as you would with spoken language.

When you press the *run* button, a *compiler* translates the Python or JavaScript instructions into machine code which the computer can understand. Then the computer *executes* the code, which causes your music appear in the DAW.

At the deepest level, computers execute code using *binary*. This means that all computer code eventually becomes `1` 's and `0` 's as it is processed by electrical components in the computer.

[[fitmedia]]
=== `fitMedia()` funktsiyasi

Endi siz birinchi skriptingizni yaratdingiz, keling, musiqangiz ustida ishlashni boshlaylik!

Watch this video to see how to add an audio clip to your song:

[role="curriculum-python curriculum-mp4"]
[[video110py]]
video::./videoMedia/1_3_fitmedia_py.mp4[]

[role="curriculum-javascript curriculum-mp4"]
[[video110js]]
video::./videoMedia/1_3_fitmedia_js.mp4[]

To add a sound to the DAW, we start by typing `fitMedia()` and use the following form.

`fitMedia(sound, track, start, end)`

There are 4 *parameters*, separated by commas.

. *Sound*: the sound constant from the sound browser
. *Track*: the track number
. *Start*: the starting measure
. *End*: the ending measure

_Example:_

`fitMedia(Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_2, 2, 1, 5)`

The statement above will place the sound `Y18_DRUM_SAMPLES_2` on track `2` from measures `1` to `5`. *bayonot* kompyuterga biror amalni bajarishni buyuradi.

Try adding `fitMedia()` to a script.

When you've finished adding all your parameters, press _run_. You will see your sounds visualized in the DAW. Press _play_ to listen to your song.

[role="curriculum-javascript"]
Note: In JavaScript an optional semicolon `;` can be added to the end of each statement. Use of the semicolon is your personal choice.

OPTIONAL

*_The Sound Browser_*

The *sound browser* provides a library of over four thousand sounds to use in your music.
Contributors include celebrity musicians

You can explore the sound browser within the *Content Manager* (left) by clicking "sounds". Try using different sound constants inside `fitMedia()`.

Note: The https://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/#/license[EarSketch License Agreement^] covers fair use of stock sounds.

Qo'shimcha vazifa uchun, quyida qilganimizdek, skriptingizga ko'proq `fitMedia()` chaqiruvlarini qo'shing. E'tibor bering, biz har bir `fitMedia()` chaqiruvi uchun farqli trek raqamidan foydalanamiz:

.PRACTICE
****
Using sounds that you like:

. Place sounds on two different tracks
. Place sounds from measure `2` to `12`
. Create a short song with three tracks that is eight measures long or more

For each exercise, you can have your neighbour listen to your song.

If you have errors when running your code, check out the next chapter about debugging.

[[debugging]]
=== Debug your code

Sometimes programmers make mistakes that cause code to work incorrectly, or not run at all. Dasturlashda kodlash xatoliklari *xatolar* yoki *nosozliklar* deb ataladi. Xatolarni topish va tuzatish jarayoni *Nosozliklarni tuzatish* deb ataladi. You can use debugging strategies, using the console.

What are the different types of errors?

. *Syntax errors*: Your program does not run because your code breaks the language's *syntax* rules (ex: you forgot to close a parenthesis, or you wrote `fitMedia` incorrectly).
. *Ijro etish xatolari*: Dasturingiz ishlay boshlaydi, lekin xato tufayli toʻxtab qoladi.
. *Mantiqiy xatolar*: Dasturingiz ishlaydi, lekin u kutilgan ishni bajarmaydi. You can fix these by looking at the DAW to check if the clips you meant to add were actually added in the right place.

Here are some common errors:

[role="curriculum-python"]
. *Imlo xatosi:* `fitMedia()` yoki tovush konstantalari kabi funktsiyadan foydalanganda imloni tekshiring.
. *Harf sezgirligi:* Dasturlashda qoʻllaniladigan soʻzlarning koʻpchiligi katta-kichik harflarga sezgir bo'ladi (kompyuter bosh va kichik harflar oʻrtasidagi farqni taniydi). Pay attention to lowercase and uppercase letters. Masalan, `FitMedia()` yoki `fitmedia()` emas, balki `fitMedia()` deb yozing. The functions in EarSketch use a style called *Camel Case*: the first word is lower case, and the first letter of subsequent words are capitalized, as in `exampleFunctionName()`.
. *Qavslar:* Qavsni kerakli joyda ochish yoki yopishni unutish <</en/v1/every-error-explained-in-detail#syntaxerror,syntax error>> hosil bo'lishiga olib keladi.
. *Script setup:* EarSketch adds some code to a new script automatically, but you might accidentally delete `from earsketch import *`.
. *Tinish belgilari:* Vergullarning mavjud emasligi yoki boshqa tinish belgilaridagi xatoliklar

Here is the answer

. The `setTempo()` function is missing a parentheses
. The first `fitMedia()` is missing an `e`
. Birinchi `fitMedia()`da uchinchi va toʻrtinchi parametrlar orasida vergul yoʻq
. The second `fitMedia()` is missing an uppercase `M`
. Ikkinchi `fitMedia()`da parametrlar tartibi toʻgʻri emas: u ovozli klip nomi, so'ng trek raqami boʻlishi kerak

=== Chapter 1 Summary

* A computer *program* is a sequence of instructions the computer executes to accomplish a specific task.
* A *script* is a nickname for a short program.
* A *DAW*, or Digital Audio Workstation, is a type of computer software for recording and editing audio. EarSketch is a DAW that lets you make music with code.
* To make music, type code into the *editor*, click "run", and click "play" to listen.
* *Sounds* can be found in the *Sound Browser*. You can add sounds to your code by using the *sound constant* in a function like `fitMedia()`.
* *Programming languages* are collections of words and symbols that are understood by the computer.
* The rules of *syntax* define how code must be written and how punctuation (`.`, `,`) is used.
* Create a new script by clicking the large blue link "Click here to create..." or the "+" icon on the editor tabs.
* `fitMedia()` is a way of adding sounds to the DAW. It has the following four parameters.
** *Sound*: the sound constant from the sound browser
** *Track*: the track number
** *Start*: the starting measure
** *End*: the ending measure
* *Debugging* is the process of finding and fixing *bugs*, or errors, made by the programmer.
* *Konsol* dasturning holati haqidagi ma'lumotlarni ko'rsatadi, bu esa sintaksis xatolarini tuzatish uchun foydali bo'ladi.
* Common programming errors include typos, incorrect cases, missing parentheses, improper script setup, and logic errors.
