# Setup
from earsketch import *
setTempo(120)

# Music
drums1 = ELECTRO_DRUM_MAIN_BEAT_008
drums2 = ELECTRO_DRUM_MAIN_BEAT_007

# Using a loop instead of repeatedly writing similar lines of code
for measure in range(1, 9):
    fitMedia(drums1, 1, measure, measure + 0.5)
    fitMedia(drums2, 1, measure + 0.5, measure + 1)
