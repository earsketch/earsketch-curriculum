:nofooter:

Let's review the material covered so far.

<<ch_1#,Chapter 1:>>

* Initially, we covered the various modules of the EarSketch workspace. <<ch_1#ESworkspace,1.3>>
* We learned about the digital audio workstation (DAW) and how to run a script to make music. <<ch_1#runningascript,1.4>>, <<ch_1#thedawindetail,1.6>>
* Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining code within a computer program. <<ch_1#whatisprogramming,1.7>>
* The code editor is where an EarSketch script is written. Comments, setup, music, and finish are the basic sections of a script. <<ch_1#sectionsofanearsketchscript,1.8>>
* The `fitMedia()` function provides the basis for composing in EarSketch. <<ch_1#composinginearsketch,1.9>>

<<ch_2#,Chapter 2:>>

* Rhythm is the arrangement of sound as music flows through time. A beat is the primary unit of time. <<ch_2#rhythm,2.1>>
* Data types are the fundamental way of representing information in a program. <<ch_2#datatypes,2.2>>
* Functions are the primary way of supplying information to the computer. <<ch_2#functions,2.3>>
* Variables are used to store information in memory. <<ch_2#variables,2.5>>

<<ch_3#,Chapter 3:>>

* Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors. It is used throughout the programming world, not just in EarSketch. We learned about syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors. <<ch_3#whatisdebugging,3.1>>
* The console supplies information about the state of program, making it a useful debugging tool. <<ch_3#usingtheconsole,3.2>>
* Comments are inserted to make code easier to understand. They keep code organized and readable. <<ch_3#documentingcode,3.3>>

<<ch_4#,Chapter 4>> and <<ch_5#,Chapter 5:>>

* `setEffect()` can be used to modify sounds in numerous ways. Supplying different arguments to `setEffect()` changes the effects it produces. <<ch_4#effectsinearsketch,4.1>>
* `setEffect()` has an extended set of arguments that are used to create envelopes, enabling effects that change over time. <<ch_5#envelopeswithseteffect,5.2>>

<<ch_6#,Chapter 6:>>

* The EarSketch sound library is organized by genre. <<ch_6#tempo,6.1>>
* Sounds within a particular folder are in the same key, or group of pitches. This means that they will sound good when used together. <<ch_6#pitch,6.2>>
* Transitions create a natural flow between sections of a piece. We experimented with a number of transition strategies. <<ch_6#transitionstrategies,6.3>>

<<ch_7#,Chapter 7:>>

* You have ownership over the music you create in EarSketch. Copyright protects your work, defining how your music can be used by others. <<ch_7#whatiscopyright,7.1>>
* It is important to obtain permission before using another person's work. Licensing allows you to easily define permissions. <<ch_7#licensingandfreeculture,7.6>>
* Willingness to share music contributes to a more free, creative environment.

<<ch_8#,Chapter 8:>>

* It is important to take a step back and evaluate your work. This ensures that your code is correct and complete. These two concepts define the quality of a script. <<ch_8#selfassessment,8.1>>
