== Unit 2 Summary
:nofooter:

The second unit covered concepts that allow code to be written more clearly and concisely. Additionally, new EarSketch functionality was introduced. Let's review.

<<ch_9#,Chapter 9:>>

* Musical form defines the arrangement of sections within a piece. <<ch_9#sectionsandform,9.1>>
* We use custom functions to code large-scale changes in musical form. You have control over the name and parameters of the functions you create. <<ch_9#customfunctions, 9.3>>
* You can create functions that return values that can be used outside of the function body. <<ch_9#returnstatements,9.4>>
* Custom functions allow blocks of code to be re-used, packing them up to form a single idea. This is known as abstraction. <<ch_9#abstraction, 9.5>>

<<ch_10#,Chapter 10:>>

* We learned how to record and upload your own sounds. <<ch_10#recordinganduploadingsounds,10.1>>
* Processes are specific tasks that run on a computer. <<ch_10#processesandmemory,10.2>>

<<ch_11#,Chapter 11:>>

* The string data type consists of a series of characters encapsulated by quotation marks. <<ch_11#strings,11.1>>
* In EarSketch, strings are frequently used to create beat strings for `makeBeat()`. <<ch_11#beatpatternswithstrings,11.2>>
* `makeBeat()` creates rhythmic patterns on a note by note basis. Its beat string determines the pattern. <<ch_11#makebeat,11.3>>

<<ch_12#,Chapter 12:>>

* For-loops execute a section of code repeatedly, reducing the length of a script and eliminating the need for large blocks of `fitMedia()` calls. They are an important tool for coding efficiently. <<ch_12#theforloop,12.1>>
* Control flow is the order in which a script executes. <<ch_12#followingcontrolflow,12.4>>
* For-loops can also be used to create more interesting effects, like changing an envelope over time. <<ch_12#automatingeffectswithloops,12.6>>

<<ch_13#,Chapter 13:>>

* We discussed methods for modifying strings, including concatenation and substring splicing. <<ch_13#stringconcatenation,13.1>>, <<ch_13#substrings,13.2>>
* Indices are the positions of characters within a string. Index zero corresponds to first character. <<ch_13#substrings,13.2>>

<<ch_14#,Chapter 14:>>

* Repetition is a key element of the human musical experience. <<ch_14#repetitioninmusic,14.1>>
* Musical contrast is also important. Sudden changes excite us and keep us interested in a piece of music. <<ch_14#contrast,14.2>>
* We experimented with a series of advanced transition techniques that utilize both repetition and contrast. <<ch_14#advancedtransitiontechniques,14.3>>

<<ch_15#,Chapter 15:>>

* Printing to the console helps you learn the state of your program and is a useful tool for debugging. <<ch_15#printingtotheconsole,15.1>>
* We outlined a process for debugging: First, attempt to reproduce the error. Read the console for clues and try to locate the error. Finally, correct the error. As programming is often a collaborative effort, don't be afraid to ask for help. <<ch_15#thedebuggingprocess,15.2>>

<<ch_16#,Chapter 16:>>

* For-loops and custom functions help make a script more concise. <<ch_16#conciseness,16.1>>
* Commenting is the most prominent way we can improve clarity of a script. <<ch_16#clarity,16.2>>
* The purpose of a script should be clear to the programmer and others who may read the script. <<ch_16#scriptheaders,16.3>>
